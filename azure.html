<h4 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">1. What is meant by Microsoft Azure and Azure diagnostic?</h4>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span class="s5">Answer: </span></strong><span class="s1">This is one of the most basic </span><span class="s6">Azure cloud interview questions</span><span class="s1"> asked very often. Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing interface that is implemented by Microsoft so as to get benefited from cloud computing.</span></p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Azure diagnostics is an API based system that collects the data to diagnose the application which is constantly running. It tunes with the verbose monitoring by enabling roles of the cloud services.</span></p>
<h4 class="p4" style="text-align: justify;">2. What is meant by cloud computing?</h4>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s5"><b>Answer:</b> </span><span class="s1">This is a basic question that finds its mention in most of the </span><span class="s6">Microsoft Azure interview questions eBook</span><span class="s1">. Cloud Computing is the high-level abstraction procedure that focuses on business logic. This is a service delivered via the internet that aids you with the computing services without laying much importance on the infrastructural needs just like the electric supply.</span></p>
<h4 class="p4" style="text-align: justify;">3. What is the scalability of cloud computing?</h4>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s5"><b>Answer:</b> </span><span class="s1">If the above question appears as the </span><span class="s6">Azure cloud interview questions</span><span class="s1"> your most appropriate answer will be scaling is one of the advantages that are of two types;</span></p>
<ul class="ul1" style="text-align: justify;">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1"><b>Vertical scaling,</b> where the configuration yields to increase the existing capacity of the machine. Just like expanding the size of the RAM from 4GB to 32GB.</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1"><b>Horizontal Scaling,</b> an aspect where the physical aspect is increased like putting multiple machines at work instead of replacing the existing machine.</span><b></b></li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="s1">4. What are the advantages of cloud computing?</span></h4>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s5"><b>Answer:</b> </span><span class="s1">There are several advantages of cloud computing which are as follows;</span></p>
<ul class="ul1" style="text-align: justify;">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">The versatility of the system can be altered if the business requires certain modification.</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">They are highly available which increases its end users to get benefited by every inch.</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">The system is capable of tolerating fault of a single part and overcomes it by remaining completely functional.</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">The service allows you to pay only when the system is in use. You can easily reallocate the system when you use them and get saved from the charge.</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">The system has brought into light the payment for the operation rather than the investment in the machines.</span><b></b></li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="s1">5. What is meant by PaaS, SaaS, and IaaS?</span></h4>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Answer: </b>These are the basic terms while dealing with the cloud services and are commonly asked in an Azure interview:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1" style="text-align: justify;">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1"><b>PaaS stands for Platform as a Service</b> that enables you to get a platform to deliver without directly giving authorization to the OS software.</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1"><b>SaaS stands for Software as a Service</b> is devoid of platform infrastructure software that can be used without direct purchase.</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1"><b>IaaS stands for Infrastructure as a Service</b> which enables you to get the hardware from the provider as the desired service which can be configured by the user.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to first create a VPN gateway with site-to-site as the option</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to create a logical resource to represent on-prem router and present it as local gateway. To establish connectivity we need to have public ip of remote router and its pre-shared key.</span></p>
<p><b>54. What does it mean by VM agent unable to communicate with Azure Backup?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possible reasons for this issue are, the Azure VM agent might be stopped, outdated, in an inconsistent state, or not installed. These states prevent the Azure Backup service from triggering snapshots or communicating with Azure Backup.</span></p>
<p><b>55. What is Gateway Transit option for a VNET?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gateway transit enables one virtual network to use the VPN gateway in the peered virtual network for cross-premises or VNet-to-VNet connectivity. To use this setting, only one of the virtual network in the peering can have a gateway configured. It is to allow peered network to reach to On-prem servers if the first VNET has a Site-to-Site VPN established already</span></p>
<p><b>56. What is the difference between standard SSD and premium SSD?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Premium SSD disks, perform better than Standard SSD disks, with very low latencies, high IOPS/throughput and even better consistency with provisioned disk performance, and it is the recommended disk type for all other production workloads.</span></p>

<p><b>57. How to deny access for one VM and allow access for one VM</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using Network security groups(NSG) or Application security group(ASG), we can define inbound rules to allow or deny access to specific vms</span></p>
<p><b>58. How to differentiate deployment VM and test VM’s in vm creation ?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no such difference option during VM creation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A VM can be differentiated on basis of applications where it hosts, and this only happens after VM is up and running.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>59. Is there any live stream between on prem ad to azure ad ?</b></p>
<p><b>AD Connect</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the tool used to sync on prem ad objects to azure ad.</span><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p><b>60. How will you do patching while migrating onprem VM?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t patch any VM during migration, we can start it after migration from the&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Azure portal.</span></p>
<p><b>61. What is Traffic manager and how it works in azure ?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traffic manager is a global load balancer, it works based on DNS. There are 6 profiles pre-defined in TM, and based on your needs you need to choose which profile is well suited.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>62. How do you troubleshoot RDP connections to an Azure virtual machine?&nbsp;</b></p>
