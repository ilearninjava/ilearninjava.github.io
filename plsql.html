            <p>PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language extensions to SQL (<a href="https://www.interviewbit.com/sql-interview-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Structured Query Language</a>). It was created by Oracle in order to overcome the disadvantages of SQL for easier building and handling of critical applications in a comprehensive manner.<br>Following are the disadvantages of SQL:</p><ul>
<li>There is no provision of decision-making, looping, and branching in <a href="https://www.scaler.com/topics/sql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>SQL</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Since the SQL statements get passed to the Oracle engine all at the same time, the speed of execution decreases due to the nature of increased traffic.</li>
<li>There is no feature of error checking while manipulating the data.</li>
</ul><p>PL/SQL was introduced to overcome the above disadvantages by retaining the power of SQL and combining it with the procedural statements. It is developed as a block-structured language and the statements of the block are passed to the oracle engine which helps to increase the speed of processing due to the decrease in traffic.</p>

          <h3>1. What are the features of PL/SQL?</h3>
          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <p>Following are the features of PL/SQL:</p><ul>
<li>PL/SQL provides the feature of decision making, looping, and branching by making use of its procedural nature.</li>
<li>Multiple queries can be processed in one block by making use of a single command using PL/SQL.</li>
<li>The PL/SQL code can be reused by applications as they can be grouped and stored in databases as PL/SQL units like functions, procedures, packages, triggers, and types.</li>
<li>PL/SQL supports exception handling by making use of an exception handling block.</li>
<li>Along with exception handling, PL/SQL also supports error checking and validation of data before data manipulation.</li>
<li>Applications developed using PL/SQL are portable across computer hardware or operating system where there is an Oracle engine.</li>

          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <ul>
<li>PL/SQL tables are nothing but objects of type tables that are modeled as database tables. They are a way to provide arrays that are nothing but temporary tables in memory for faster processing.</li>
<li>These tables are useful for moving bulk data thereby simplifying the process.</li>

          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <ul>
<li>The basic structure of PL/SQL follows the BLOCK structure. Each PL/SQL code comprises SQL and PL/SQL statement that constitutes a PL/SQL block.</li>
<li>Each PL/SQL block consists of 3 sections:<ul>
<li>The optional Declaration Section</li>
<li>The mandatory Execution Section</li>
<li>The optional Exception handling Section</li>
</ul>

        <section class="ibpage-article-header" id="pl-sql-cursor">
          <h3>4. What is a PL/SQL cursor?</h3>
          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <ul>
<li>A PL/SQL cursor is nothing but a pointer to an area of memory having SQL statements and the information of statement processing. This memory area is called a context area. This special area makes use of a special feature called cursor for the purpose of retrieving and processing more than one row.</li>
<li>In short, the cursor selects multiple rows from the database and these selected rows are individually processed within a program.</li>
<li>There are two types of cursors:<ul>
<li>
<strong>Implicit Cursor</strong>:<ul>
<li>Oracle automatically creates a cursor while running any of the commands - SELECT INTO, INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE implicitly.</li>
<li>The execution cycle of these cursors is internally handled by Oracle and returns the information and status of the cursor by making use of the cursor attributes- ROWCOUNT, ISOPEN, FOUND, NOTFOUND.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Explicit Cursor:</strong><ul>
<li>This cursor is a SELECT statement that was declared explicitly in the declaration block.</li>
<li>The programmer has to control the execution cycle of these cursors starting from OPEN to FETCH and close.</li>
<li>The execution cycle while executing the SQL statement is defined by Oracle along with associating a cursor with it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Explicit Cursor Execution Cycle:</strong><ul><li>Due to the flexibility of defining our own execution cycle, explicit cursors are used in many instances. The following diagram represents the execution flow of an explicit cursor:</li></ul>
</li>
</ul><figure class="image"><img data-src="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/myinterviewtrainer-domestic/public_assets/assets/000/000/260/original/Explicit_Cursor_Execution_Cycle.jpg?1617182013" class="" src="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/myinterviewtrainer-domestic/public_assets/assets/000/000/260/original/Explicit_Cursor_Execution_Cycle.jpg?1617182013"></figure><ul>
<li>
<strong>Cursor Declaration:</strong><ul>
<li>The first step to use an explicit cursor is its declaration.</li>
<li>Declaration can be done in a package or a block.</li>
<li>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> <code>CURSOR cursor_name IS query; </code>where cursor_name is the name of the cursor, the query is the query to fetch data from any table.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Open Cursor:</strong><ul>
<li>Before the process of fetching rows from cursor, the cursor has to be opened.</li>
<li>
<strong>Syntax</strong> to open a cursor: <code>OPEN cursor_name;</code>
</li>
<li>When the cursor is opened, the query and the bind variables are parsed by Oracle and the SQL statements are executed.</li>
<li>The execution plan is determined by Oracle and the result set is determined after associating the cursor parameters and host variables and post these, the cursor is set to point at the first row of the result set.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Fetch from cursor:</strong><ul>
<li>FETCH statement is used to place the content of the current row into variables.</li>
<li>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> <code>FETCH cursor_name INTO variable_list;</code>
</li>
<li>In order to get all the rows of a result set, each row needs to be fetched.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Close Cursor:</strong><ul>
<li>Once all the rows are fetched, the cursor needs to be closed using the CLOSE statement.</li>
<li>
<strong>Syntax</strong>: <code>CLOSE cursor_name;</code>
</li>
<li>The instructions tell Oracle to release the memory allocated to the cursor.<ul>
<li>Cursors declared in procedures or anonymous blocks are by default closed post their execution.</li>
<li>Cursors declared in packages need to be closed explicitly as the scope is global.</li>
<li>Closing a cursor that is not opened will result in INVALID_CURSOR exception.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <ul>
<li>We use this clause while referencing the current row from an explicit cursor. This clause allows applying updates and deletion of the row currently under consideration without explicitly referencing the row ID.</li>

        <section class="ibpage-article-header" id="plsql-execution-architecture">
          <h3>11. Can you explain the PL/SQL execution architecture?</h3>
          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <p>The PL/SQL engine does the process of compilation and execution of the PL/SQL blocks and programs and can only work if it is installed on an Oracle server or any application tool that supports Oracle such as Oracle Forms.</p><ul>
<li>PL/SQL is one of the parts of Oracle RDBMS, and it is important to know that most of the Oracle applications are developed using the client-server architecture. The Oracle database forms the server-side and requests to the database form a part of the client-side.</li>
<li>So based on the above fact and the fact that PL/SQL is not a standalone programming language, we must realize that the PL/SQL engine can reside in either the client environment or the server environment. This makes it easy to move PL/SQL modules and sub-programs between server-side and client-side applications.</li>
<li>Based on the architecture shown below, we can understand that PL/SQL engine plays an important role in the process and execute the PL/SQL statements and whenever it encounters the SQL statements, they are sent to the SQL Statement Processor.</li>
</ul><figure class="image image_resized" style="width:75%;"><img data-src="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/myinterviewtrainer-domestic/public_assets/assets/000/000/262/original/pl-sql-architecture.jpg?1617185061" class="" src="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/myinterviewtrainer-domestic/public_assets/assets/000/000/262/original/pl-sql-architecture.jpg?1617185061"></figure><ul>
<li>
<strong>Case 1:</strong> <strong>PL/SQL engine is on the server:</strong> In this case, the whole PL/SQL block gets passed to the PL/SQL engine present on the Oracle server which is then processed and the response is sent.</li>
<li>
<strong>Case 2: PL/SQL engine is on the client:</strong> Here the engine lies within the Oracle Developer tools and the processing of the PL/SQL statements is done on the client-side.<ul>
<li>In case, there are any SQL statements in the PL/SQL block, then they are sent to the Oracle server for SQL processing.</li>
<li>When there are no SQL statements, then the whole block processing occurs at the client-side.</li>

            <ul>
<li>
<strong>%TYPE:</strong> This declaration is used for the purpose of anchoring by providing the data type of any variable, column, or constant. It is useful during the declaration of a variable that has the same data type as that of its table <strong>column</strong>.<ul><li>Consider the example of declaring a variable named <code>ib_employeeid</code> which has the data type and its size same as that of the column <code>employeeid</code> in table <code>ib_employee</code>.&nbsp;<br>The syntax would be : <code>ib_employeeid ib_employee.employeeid%TYPE;</code>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>%ROWTYPE: </strong>This is used for declaring a variable that has the same data type and size as that of a row in the table. The row of a table is called a record and its fields would have the same data types and names as the columns defined in the table.<ul><li>For example: In order to declare a record named <code>ib_emprecord</code> for storing an entire row in a table called <code>ib_employee</code>, the syntax is:<br><code>ib_emprecord ib_employee%ROWTYPE;</code>

<li>
<strong>LEFT:</strong> This function returns the specified number of characters from the left part of a string.<ul>

          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <ul>
<li>
<strong>ROLLBACK command</strong> is used for rolling back all the changes from the beginning of the transaction.</li>
<li>
<strong>ROLLBACK TO command</strong> is used for undoing the transaction only till a SAVEPOINT. The transactions cannot be rolled back before the SAVEPOINT and hence the transaction remains active even before the command is specified.</li>

          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <ul>
<li>These are the three transaction specifications that are available in PL/SQL.</li>
<li>
<strong>COMMIT: </strong>Whenever any DML operations are performed, the data gets manipulated only in the database buffer and not the actual database. In order to save these DML transactions to the database, there is a need to COMMIT these transactions.<ul>
<li>COMMIT transaction action does saving of all the outstanding changes since the last commit and the below steps take place:<ul>
<li>The release of affected rows.</li>
<li>The transaction is marked as complete.</li>
<li>The details of the transaction would be stored in the data dictionary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> COMMIT;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>ROLLBACK:</strong> In order to undo or erase the changes that were done in the current transaction, the changes need to be rolled back. ROLLBACK statement erases all the changes since the last COMMIT.<ul><li>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> ROLLBACK;</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>SAVEPOINT:</strong> This statement gives the name and defines a point in the current transaction process where any changes occurring before that SAVEPOINT would be preserved whereas all the changes after that point would be released.<ul><li>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> SAVEPOINT &lt;savepoint_name&gt;;</li></ul>
