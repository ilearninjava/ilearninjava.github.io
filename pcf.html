            <h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Pivotal_Cloud_Foundry_Software_Engineer_Interview_Questions"></span>Pivotal Cloud Foundry Software Engineer Interview Questions<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>
            <p><strong>Cloud Foundry Interview Questions # 20) How the </strong>nsync<strong>, BBS, and Cell Rep components work together?</strong></p>
            <p>A) nsync receives a message from the Cloud Controller when the user scales an app. It writes the number of instances into a DesiredLRP structure in the Diego BBS database.</p>
            <p>BBS uses its convergence process to monitor the DesiredLRP and ActualLRP values. It launches or kills application instances as appropriate to ensure the ActualLRP count matches the DesiredLRP count.</p>
            <p>Cell Rep monitors the containers and provides the ActualLRP value.</p>
            <p><strong>Cloud Foundry Interview Questions # 21) What is Blobstore?</strong></p>
            <p>A) The blobstore is a repository for large binary files, which Github cannot easily manage because Github is designed for code. The blobstore contains the following:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Application code packages</li>
            <li>Buildpacks</li>
            <li>Droplets</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>22) What is Diego Cell?</strong></p>

            <p>A lightweight SSH daemon.</p>
            <p><strong>34) What is SSH Daemon?</strong></p>
            <p>A) The SSH daemon is a lightweight implementation that is built around the Go SSH library. It supports command execution, interactive shells, local port forwarding, and secure copy. The daemon is self-contained and has no dependencies on the container root file system.</p>
            <p><strong>35) What is SSH Proxy Authentication?</strong></p>
            <p>A) The SSH proxy hosts the user-accessible SSH endpoint and is responsible for authentication, policy enforcement, and access controls in the context of Cloud Foundry. After a user has successfully authenticated with the proxy, the proxy will attempt to locate the target container and create an SSH session to a daemon running inside the container. After both sessions have been established, the proxy will manage the communication between the user’s SSH client and the container’s SSH Daemon.</p>
            <p><strong>36) What is role-based access control (RBAC) system in CF?</strong></p>
            <p>A) CF uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system to grant Cloud Foundry users permissions appropriate to their role within an org or a space.</p>
            <p><strong>37) What are the security features available in Cloud Foundry?</strong></p>
            <p>A) Cloud Foundry implements the following measures to mitigate against security threats:</p>
            <p>Minimizes network surface area</p>
            <p>Isolates customer applications and data in containers</p>
            <p>Encrypts connections</p>
            <p>Uses role-based access controls, applying and enforcing roles and permissions to ensure that users can only view and affect the spaces for which they have been granted access</p>
            <p>Ensures security of application bits in a multi-tenant environment</p>
            <p>Prevents possible denial of service attacks through resource starvation</p>
            <p><strong>38) What are Isolation Segments?</strong></p>
            <p>A) Isolation segments provide dedicated pools of resources to which apps can be deployed to isolate workloads. Using isolation segments separates app resources as completely as if they were in different CF deployments but avoids redundant management components and unneeded network complexity.</p>
            <p><strong>39) Explain about Software Vulnerability Management in CF?</strong></p>
            <p>A) Cloud Foundry manages software vulnerability using releases and BOSH stemcells. New Cloud Foundry releases are created with updates to address code issues, while new stemcells are created with patches for the latest security fixes to address any underlying operating system issues.</p>

            <p><strong>40) Can you describe </strong>about<strong> Container Security in CF?</strong></p>
            <p>A) Cloud Foundry (CF) secures the containers that host application instances on Linux.</p>
            <p>Container Mechanics provides an overview of container isolation.</p>
            <p>Inbound and Outbound Traffic from CF provides an overview of container networking and describes how CF administrators customize container network traffic rules for their deployment.</p>
            <p>Container Security describes how CF secures containers by running application instances in unprivileged containers and by hardening them.</p>
            <p><strong>41) What measures </strong>CF can<strong> take for Container Security?</strong></p>
            <p>A) CF secures containers through the following measures:</p>
            <p>Running application instances in unprivileged containers by default</p>
            <p>Hardening containers by limiting functionality and access rights</p>
            <p>Only allowing outbound connections to public addresses from application containers. This is the original default. Administrators can change this behavior by configuring ASGs.</p>
            <p><strong>42) What is Container-to-Container Networking?</strong></p>
            <p>A) The Container-to-Container Networking feature enables app instances to communicate with each other directly. Container-to-Container Networking integrates with Garden-runC in a Diego deployment. The Container-to-Container Networking BOSH release includes several core components, as well as swappable components.</p>
            <p><strong>43) What are the components of Container-to-Container Networking?</strong></p>
            <p>A) The Container-to-Container Networking BOSH release includes the following core components:</p>
            <p>Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (CF CLI) plugin</p>
            <p>Policy Server</p>
            <p>Garden External Networker</p>
            <p>The Container-to-Container Networking BOSH release includes the following swappable components:</p>
            <p>Silk CNI plugin</p>
            <p>VXLAN Policy Agent</p>
            <p><strong>44) What is Zipkin Tracing?</strong></p>
            <p>A) Zipkin is a tracing system that enables app developers to troubleshoot failures or latency issues. Zipkin provides the ability to trace requests and responses across distributed systems.</p>
            <p><strong>45) What is a Stack?</strong></p>
            <p>A) A stack is a prebuilt root filesystem (rootfs) that supports a specific operating system. For example, Linux-based systems need /usr and /bin directories at their root. The stack works in tandem with a buildpack to support applications running in compartments. Under Diego architecture, cell VMs can support multiple stacks.</p>
            <p><strong>46) How do you deploy Cloud Foundry?</strong></p>
            <p>A) If installing Cloud Foundry for the first time, deploy with cf-deployment.</p>
            <p>If you have an existing Cloud Foundry deployment that uses cf-release, migrate your deployment to cf-deployment.</p>
            <p><strong>47) How do you add a Buildpack?</strong></p>
            <p>A) To add a buildpack, run the cf create-buildpack BUILDPACK PATH POSITION [–enable|–disable] command.</p>
            <p><strong>48) How do you use Docker in Cloud Foundry?</strong></p>
            <p>A) By default, apps deployed with the cf push command run in standard Cloud Foundry Linux containers. With Docker support enabled, Cloud Foundry can also deploy and manage apps running in Docker containers.</p>
            <p>To deploy apps to Docker, developers run cf push with the –docker-image option and the location of a Docker image to create the containers from.</p>
            <p>To enable Docker support on a CF deployment, an operator must do the following:</p>
            <p>Enable the diego_docker feature flag.</p>
            <p>Configure access to any Docker registries that developers want to use images from.</p>
