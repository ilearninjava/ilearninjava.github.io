            <p>A Unit Test Case is a part of code which ensures that the another part of code (method) works as expected. To achieve those desired results quickly, test framework is required .JUnit is perfect unit test framework for java programming language.</p>

            <ui><li><label><strong> What are the best practices to write a Unit Test Case?</strong></label></li></ui>
            <div class="toggle-content">
            <p>A formal written unit test case is characterized by a known input and by an expected output, which is worked out before the test is executed. The known input should test a precondition and the expected output should test a postcondition.</p>
            <p>There must be at least two unit test cases for each requirement: one positive test and one negative test. If a requirement has sub-requirements, each sub-requirement must have at least two test cases as positive and negative.</p>

            <div class="toggle-content">
            <p>Debugging the code using system.out.println() will lead to manual scanning of the whole output every time the program is run to ensure the code is doing the expected operations. Moreover, in the long run, it takes lesser time to code JUnit methods and test them on class files.</p>

            <div class="toggle-content">
            <p>Follow the steps below −</p>
            <ol class="list">
            <li><p>Download the latest version of JUnit, referred to below as junit.zip.</p></li>
            <li><p>Unzip the junit.zip distribution file to a directory referred to as %JUNIT_HOME%.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add JUnit to the classpath −</p></li>
            </ol>
            <pre class="result notranslate">set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;%JUNIT_HOME%\junit.jar
            </pre>
            <ul class="list">
            <li><p>Test the installation by running the sample tests distributed with JUnit (sample tests are located in the installation directory directly, not the junit.jar file). Then simply type −</p></li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="result notranslate">java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore org.junit.tests.AllTests
            </pre>
            <ul class="list">
            <li><p>All the tests should pass with an "OK" message. If the tests don't pass, verify that junit.jar is in the CLASSPATH.</p></li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            
            
            <ui><li><label><strong> Why does JUnit only report the first failure in a single test?</strong></label></li></ui>
            <div class="toggle-content">
            <p>Reporting multiple failures in a single test is generally a sign that the test does too much and it is too big a unit test. JUnit is designed to work best with a number of small tests. It executes each test within a separate instance of the test class. It reports failure on each test.</p>
            </div>
            
            
            <ui><li><label><strong> In Java, assert is a keyword. Won't this conflict with JUnit's assert() method?</strong></label></li></ui>
            <div class="toggle-content">
            <p>JUnit 3.7 deprecated assert() and replaced it with assertTrue(), which works exactly the same way. JUnit 4 is compatible with the assert keyword. If you run with the -ea JVM switch, assertions that fail will be reported by JUnit.</p>

            <ui><li><label><strong> How do I test things that must be run in a J2EE container (e.g. servlets, EJBs)?</strong></label></li></ui>
            <div class="toggle-content">
            <p>Refactoring J2EE components to delegate functionality to other objects that don't have to be run in a J2EE container will improve the design and testability of the software. Cactus is an open source JUnit extension that can be used for unit testing server-side java code.</p>

            <li><p>Create an instance variable for each "column" of test data.</p></li>

            <div class="toggle-content">
            <p>Fixtures is a fixed state of a set of objects used as a baseline for running tests. The purpose of a test fixture is to ensure that there is a well known and fixed environment in which tests are run so that results are repeatable. It includes −</p>

            <div class="toggle-content">
            <p>Compiling a JUnit test class is like compiling any other Java classes. The only thing you need watch out is that the JUnit JAR file must be included in the classpath.</p>

            <ui><li><label><strong> What happens if a JUnit Test Method is Declared as "private"?</strong></label></li></ui>
            <div class="toggle-content">
            <p>If a JUnit test method is declared as "private", it compiles successfully. But the execution will fail. This is because JUnit requires that all test methods must be declared as "public".</p>

            <ui><li><label><strong> How do you test a "protected" method?</strong></label></li></ui>
            <div class="toggle-content">
            <p>When a method is declared as "protected", it can only be accessed within the same package where the class is defined. Hence to test a "protected" method of a target class, define your test class in the same package as the target class.</p>

            <ui><li><label><strong> How do you test a "private" method?</strong></label></li></ui>
            <div class="toggle-content">
            <p>When a method is declared as "private", it can only be accessed within the same class. So there is no way to test a "private" method of a target class from any test class. Hence you need to perform unit testing manually. Or you have to change your method from "private" to "protected".</p>
            </div>
            
            
            <ui><li><label><strong> What happens if a JUnit test method is declared to return "String"?</strong></label></li></ui>
            <div class="toggle-content">
            <p>If a JUnit test method is declared to return "String", the compilation will pass ok. But the execution will fail. This is because JUnit requires that all test methods must be declared to return "void".</p>

            <ui><li><label><strong> Can you use a main() Method for Unit Testing?</strong></label></li></ui>
            <div class="toggle-content">
            <p>Yes you can test using main() method. One obvious advantage seems to be that you can whitebox test the class. That is, you can test the internals of it (private methods for example). You can't do that with unit-tests. But primarily the test framework tests the interface and the behavior from the user's perspective.</p>

            <div class="toggle-content">
            <p>No. We need not write an independent test class for every class that needs to be tested. If there is a small group of tests sharing a common test fixture, you may move those tests to a new test class.</p>

            <div class="toggle-content">
            <p>The test runner holds strong references to all Test instances for the duration of the test execution. This means that for a very long test run with many Test instances, none of the tests may be garbage collected until the end of the entire test run. Explicitly setting an object to null in the tearDown() method, for example, allows it to be garbage collected before the end of the entire test run.</p>

This includes navigation via links, form entry and submission, validation of table contents, and other typical business web application features.</p>
            <p>The simple navigation methods and ready-to-use assertions allow for more rapid test creation than using only JUnit or HtmlUnit. And if you want to switch from HtmlUnit to other plugins such as Selenium (available soon), there is no need to rewrite your tests.</p>
