                  <p><strong>Introduction to Docker:</strong><br>Docker is a very popular and powerful open-source containerization platform that is used for building, deploying, and running applications. Docker allows you to decouple the application/software from the underlying infrastructure.<br><br><strong>What is a Container?</strong><br>A container is a standard unit of software bundled with dependencies so that applications can be deployed fast and reliably b/w different computing platforms.</p><ul>
      <li>Docker can be visualized as a big ship (docker) carrying huge boxes of products (containers).</li>
      <li>Docker container doesn‚Äôt require the installation of a separate operating system. Docker just relies or makes use of the kernel‚Äôs resources and its functionality to allocate them for the CPU and memory it relies on the kernel‚Äôs functionality and uses resource isolation for CPU and memory, and separate namespaces to isolate the application‚Äôs view of the OS (operating system).</li>
      </ul><p><strong>Why Learn Docker?</strong><br>Application development is a lot more than just writing code! They involve a lot of behind-the-scenes things like usage of multiple frameworks and architectures for every stage of its lifecycle which makes the process more complex and challenging. Using the nature of containerization helps developers to simplify and efficiently accelerate the application workflow along with giving them the liberty to develop using their own choice of technology and development environments.</p><ul>
      <li>All these aspects form the core part of DevOps which becomes all the more important for any developer to know these in order to improve productivity, fasten the development along with keeping in mind the factors of application scalability and more efficient resource management.</li>
      <li>Imagine containers as a very lightweight pre-installed box with all the packages, dependencies, software required by your application, just deploy to production with minimal configuration changes.</li>
      <li>Lots of companies like PayPal, Spotify, Uber, etc use Docker to simplify the operations and to bring the infrastructure and security closer to make more secure applications.</li>
      <li>Being portable, Containers can be deployed on multiple platforms like bare instances, virtual machines, Kubernetes platform etc. as per requirements of scale or desired platform.</li>
      </ul>

      <li>In simplest terms, docker containers consist of applications and all their dependencies.</li>
      <li>They share the kernel and system resources with other containers and run as isolated systems in the host operating system.</li>
      <li>The main aim of docker containers is to get rid of the infrastructure dependency while deploying and running applications. This means that any containerized application can run on any platform irrespective of the infrastructure being used beneath.</li>
      <li>Technically, they are just the runtime instances of docker images.</li>

                <article class="ibpage-article">
                  <p>A hypervisor is a software that makes virtualization happen because of which is sometimes referred to as the Virtual Machine Monitor. This divides the resources of the host system and allocates them to each guest environment installed.</p>
                  <ul><li>This means that multiple OS can be installed on a single host system. Hypervisors are of 2 types:<br><br>1. <strong>Native Hypervisor:</strong> This type is also called a Bare-metal Hypervisor and runs directly on the underlying host system which also ensures direct access to the host hardware which is why it does not require base OS.<br>2. <strong>Hosted Hypervisor:</strong> This type makes use of the underlying host operating system which has the existing OS installed.</li></ul>

                  <p>It is a YAML file consisting of all the details regarding various services, networks, and volumes that are needed for setting up the Docker-based application. So, docker-compose is used for creating multiple containers, host them and establish communication between them. For the purpose of communication amongst the containers, ports are exposed by each and every container.</p>

                <article class="ibpage-article">
                  <p>A namespace is basically a Linux feature that ensures OS resources partition in a mutually exclusive manner. This forms the core concept behind containerization as namespaces introduce a layer of isolation amongst the containers. In docker, the namespaces ensure that the containers are portable and they don't affect the underlying host. Examples for namespace types that are currently being supported by Docker ‚Äì PID, Mount, User, Network, IPC.</p>

                  <ul>
      <li>The syntax of docker run when using the volumes is: <code>docker run -v host_path:docker_path &lt;container_name&gt;</code>
      </li>
      <li>The volume parameter is used for syncing a directory of a container with any of the host directories. Consider the below command as an example: <code>docker run -v /data/app:usr/src/app myapp</code><br>The above command mounts the directory &nbsp;<code>/data/app</code> in the host to the <code>usr/src/app</code> directory. We can sync the container with the data files from the host without having the need to restart it.</li>
      <li>This also ensures data security in cases of container deletion. This ensures that even if the container is deleted, the data of the container exists in the volume mapped host location making it the easiest way to store the container data.</li>

      <li>Using the up command for keeping a docker-compose up (ideally at all times), we can start or restart all the networks, services, and drivers associated with the app that are specified in the docker-compose.yml file. Now if we are running the docker-compose up in the ‚Äúattached‚Äù mode then all the logs from the containers would be accessible to us. In case the docker-compose is run in the ‚Äúdetached‚Äù mode, then once the containers are started, it just exits and shows no logs.</li>
      <li>Using the run command, the docker-compose can run one-off or ad-hoc tasks based on the business requirements. Here, the service name has to be provided and the docker starts only that specific service and also the other services to which the target service is dependent (if any).<br>- This command is helpful for testing the containers and also performing tasks such as adding or removing data to the container volumes etc.</li>
      <li>Using the start command, only those containers can be restarted which were already created and then stopped. This is not useful for creating new containers on its own.</li>

      <strong>Daemon Level:</strong> This kind of logging has four levels- Debug, Info, Error, and Fatal.<br>- Debug has all the data that happened during the execution of the daemon process.<br>- Info carries all the information along with the error information during the execution of the daemon process.<br>- Errors have those errors that occurred during the execution of the daemon process.<br>- Fatal has the fatal errors that occurred during the execution.</li>

                  <p>DevOps technologies are growing at an exponential pace. As the systems are being more and more distributed, developers have turned towards containerization because of the need to develop software faster and maintain them better. They also aid in easier and faster continuous integration and deployment process which is why these technologies have experienced tremendous growth.</p><p>Docker is the most famous and popular tool for achieving the purpose of containerization and continuous integration/development and also for continuous deployment due to its great support for pipelines. With the growing ecosystem, docker has proven itself to be useful to operate on multiple use cases thereby making it all the more exciting to learn it!<br><br>To build a good DockerFile: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/</a></p>
