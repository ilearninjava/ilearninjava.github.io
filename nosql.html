          <p><img alt="Top 10 NoSQL Databases in 2022" src="assets/img/Top 10 NoSQL Databases in 2022.png" style="height:100%; width:100%"></p>
<h3>1. <strong>MongoDB</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> is a source-available document-oriented cross-platform database program. MongoDB is classified as a NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB also offers indexing, ad hoc queries and real-time aggregation to powerfully access and analyze data. Being a distributed database, MongoDB comes with higher availability, geographical distribution, and horizontal scalability. MongoDB also provides SSL, encryption and firewall security for its client, making it the top <a href="https://www.decipherzone.com/hire-developer">choice for application developers</a>.</p>
<h3>2. <strong>Apache Cassandra</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html">Apache Cassandra</a> is an open-source distributed NoSQL database that offers high scalability and availability without affecting the performance of the application. Apache Cassandra manages unstructured data with thousands of writes every second. Proven fault tolerance and linear scalability on cloud infrastructure or commodity hardware make Cassandra a perfect choice for mission-critical data. To assure scalability and reliability, Cassandra is tested on 1000 node clusters, 100 real-world schemas and use cases by Apple, Netflix, Amazon and others. Besides, it can even handle failed replacements of nodes without shutting down the system. Cassandra also replicates data across multiple nodes automatically, making it an ideal choice for developers.</p>
<h3>3. <strong>Apache HBase</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://hbase.apache.org/">HBase</a> is a column-oriented, open-source, distributed, non-relational database that works on the Hadoop Database File System. Apache HBase can be used when you randomly need real-time read/write access to Big Data. It provides linear scalability, consistent read/write, automatic configurable table sharding, easy-to-use <a href="https://www.decipherzone.com/blog-detail/api-vs-web-services-vs-microservices">Java API</a> for client access, real-time queries and so much more. HBase is based on Google’s Bigtable, a distributed storage system for structured data to offer Bigtable-like capabilities for applications.</p>
<h3>4. <strong>Apache CouchDB</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">Apache CouchDB</a> is a document-oriented, open-source, single node NoSQL database that allows you to store your data with JSON documents and easily access it through a web browser. CouchDB uses multiple protocols and formats to store, process and transfer data. For demanding projects, CouchDB can scale up into a cluster of nodes with multiple servers. It has been designed with a crash-resistant structure and reliability that supports “offline first” apps and a system that redundantly saves data to keep it secure and available in case of emergency.</p>
<h3>5. <strong>Neo4j</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a> is an open-source, graph-based, NoSQL database that provides an ACID-compliant transactional <a href="https://www.decipherzone.com/blog-detail/successful-app-development">application</a> backend, runtime failover, and cluster support. The cypher query language, constant time traversals, drivers for programming languages like <a href="https://www.decipherzone.com/blog-detail/react-vs-vue">JavaScript</a>, Java, Go, and Python, and flexibility offered by Neo4j makes it easier to work with. As Neo4j connects the data when stored in the database, it can quickly access the data again than conventional databases. And since it doesn’t have tables there is no need for joins as well.</p>
<h3>6. <strong>RavenDB</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://ravendb.net/">RavenDB</a> is an open-source NoSQL database for .NET. that offers all the benefits of a NoSQL database along with the pros of a relational database. RavenDB also provides completely transactional (ACID) data integrity across the cluster and database so that it can be used with the existing SQL database and get the most out of both databases. RavenDB is highly scalable that’s why it creates new nodes in case of an increase in data traffic.</p>
<h3>7. <strong>Redis</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> is also an open-source, in-memory data structure store. Redis is used as a cache, database and message broker that comes with optional durability. Redis also possesses bitmaps, range queries, streams, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes along with data structures like sets, hashes, strings, sorted sets, and lists. Redis is written in ANSI C and can be used with nearly all of the programming languages. With its in-memory dataset, Redis preserves its extremely fast performance. Other features that Redis includes are automatic failover, Lua Scripting, transactions, Pub/Sub, keys with a limited lifetime, and more.</p>
<h3>8. <strong>OrientDB</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.orientdb.org/">OrientDB</a> is an open-source NoSQL database that blends the flexibility of documents and the power of graphs into a high-performing, scalable operational database. OrientDB is written in Java and is fast on both read/write operations. OrientDB also provides high performance, a smaller footprint, enhanced scalability, reliability, higher security, and schema flexibility for your <a href="https://www.decipherzone.com/blog-detail/best-practices-secure-app-development">application</a> data persistence needs.</p>
<h3>9. <strong>DynamoDB</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">DynamoDB</a> is a fully managed NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services that support document data structure and key-value cloud services. DynamoDB offers seamless scalability with faster performance. It also offers encryption at rest to eliminate the complexity of protecting sensitive data. With DynamoDB, you also get on-demand backup capabilities and enable point-in-time recovery for DynamoDB tables. It helps developers in auto-scaling, back-up, restore and in-memory caching for application data.</p>
<h3>10. <strong>HyperTable</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://hypertable.org/">HyperTable</a> is an open-source NoSQL database that is written in C++ and based on Google’s BigTable <a href="https://www.decipherzone.com/blog-detail/top-web-design-trends-2022">design</a>. HyperTable was designed to overcome the relational databases’ scalability issues. HyperTable also supports comprehensive languages like Node.js, Java, Ruby, Perl, PHP, Python, and more. It also offers maximum efficiency of the data with minimum stability and performance costs.</p>
<pre><big>Choosing the Right NoSQL Database</big></pre>
<p>Although each one of them is quite popular among mobile/<a href="https://www.decipherzone.com/contact-IT-company">web application development companies</a>, MongoDB and Apache Cassandra are the preferred ones. Undoubtedly, NoSQL databases are highly reliable due to their scalability for large data storage and processing. But, while choosing the ideal NoSQL database for your business or project, you should consider the one that offers the features and functionality required. Some of the factors to consider for selecting the right database are scale-out architecture, flexible schemas, fast-paced agile development, storage for structured and unstructured high volume data, and <a href="https://www.decipherzone.com/blog-detail/why-microservices-architecture">microservices</a> plus real-time streaming support.</p>
