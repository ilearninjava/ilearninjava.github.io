              <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
            <p>Sorting data means arranging it in a certain order, often in an array-like data structure. You can use various ordering criteria, common ones being sorting numbers from least to greatest or vice-versa, or sorting strings <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order">lexicographically</a>. You can even define your own criteria, and we'll go into practical ways of doing that by the end of this article.</p>
            <p>If you're interested in how sorting works, we'll cover various algorithms, from inefficient but intuitive solutions, to efficient algorithms which are actually implemented in Java and other languages.</p>
            <p>There are various sorting algorithms, and they're not all equally efficient. We'll be analyzing their <a target="_blank" href="/big-o-notation-and-algorithm-analysis-with-python-examples/">time complexity</a> in order to compare them and see which ones perform the best.</p>
            <p>The list of algorithms you'll learn here is by no means exhaustive, but we have compiled some of the most common and most efficient ones to help you get started,</p>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: This article will <strong>not</strong> be dealing with concurrent sorting, since it's meant for beginners.</p>
            <h3 id="bubblesort">Bubble Sort</h3>
            <h4 id="explanation">Explanation</h4>
            <p>Bubble sort works by swapping adjacent elements if they're not in the desired order. This process repeats from the beginning of the array until all elements are in order.</p>
            <p>We know that all elements are in order when we manage to do the whole iteration without swapping at all - then all elements we compared were in the desired order with their adjacent elements, and by extension, the whole array.</p>
            <p>Here are the steps for sorting an array of numbers from least to greatest:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            <p><strong>4 2</strong> 1 5 3: The first two elements are in the wrong order, so we swap them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>2 <strong>4 1</strong> 5 3: The second two elements are in the wrong order too, so we swap.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>2 1 <strong>4 5</strong> 3: These two are in the right order, 4 &lt; 5, so we leave them alone.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>2 1 4 <strong>5 3</strong>: Another swap.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>2 1 4 3 5: Here's the resulting array after one iteration.</p>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because at least one swap occurred during the first pass (there were actually three), we need to go through the whole array again and repeat the same process.</p>
            <p>By repeating this process, until no more swaps are made, we'll have a sorted array.</p>
            <p>The reason this algorithm is called Bubble Sort is because the numbers kind of "bubble up" to the "surface." If you go through our example again, following a particular number (4 is a great example), you'll see it slowly moving to the right during the process.</p>
            <p>All numbers move to their respective places bit by bit, left to right, like bubbles slowly rising from a body of water.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <h4 id="implementation">Implementation</h4>
            <p>We're going to implement Bubble Sort in a similar way we've laid it out in words. Our function enters a while loop in which it goes through the entire array swapping as needed.</p>
            <p>We assume the array is sorted, but if we're proven wrong while sorting (if a swap happens), we go through another iteration. The while-loop then keeps going until we manage to pass through the entire array without swapping:</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">bubbleSort</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>[] a)</span> </span>{
                <span class="hljs-keyword">boolean</span> sorted = <span class="hljs-keyword">false</span>;
                <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> temp;
                <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span>(!sorted) {
                    sorted = <span class="hljs-keyword">true</span>;
                    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; array.length - <span class="hljs-number">1</span>; i++) {
                        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (a[i] &gt; a[i+<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]) {
                            temp = a[i];
                            a[i] = a[i+<span class="hljs-number">1</span>];
                            a[i+<span class="hljs-number">1</span>] = temp;
                            sorted = <span class="hljs-keyword">false</span>;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            </code></pre>
            <p>When using this algorithm we have to be careful how we state our swap condition.</p>
            <p>For example, if I had used <code>a[i] &gt;= a[i+1]</code> it could have ended up with an infinite loop, because for equal elements this relation would always be <code>true</code>, and hence always swap them.</p>
            <h4 id="timecomplexity">Time Complexity</h4>
            <p>To figure out time complexity of Bubble Sort, we need to look at the worst possible scenario. What's the maximum number of times we need to pass through the whole array before we've sorted it? Consider the following example:</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs">5 4 3 2 1
            </code></pre>
            <p>In the first iteration, 5 will "bubble up to the surface," but the rest of the elements would stay in descending order. We would have to do one iteration for each element except 1, and then another iteration to check that everything is in order, so a total of 5 iterations.</p>
            <p>Expand this to any array of <code>n</code> elements, and that means you need to do <code>n</code> iterations. Looking at the code, that would mean that our <code>while</code> loop can run the maximum of <code>n</code> times.</p>
            <p>Each of those <code>n</code> times we're iterating through the whole array (for-loop in the code), meaning the worst case time complexity would be <strong>O(n^2)</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: The time complexity would <em>always</em> be <strong>O(n^2)</strong> if it weren't for the <code>sorted</code> boolean check, which terminates the algorithm if there aren't any swaps within the inner loop - which means that the array is sorted.</p>
            <h3 id="insertionsort">Insertion Sort</h3>
            <h4 id="explanation">Explanation</h4>
            <p>The idea behind Insertion Sort is dividing the array into the <em>sorted</em> and <em>unsorted</em> subarrays.</p>
            <p>The sorted part is of length 1 at the beginning and is corresponding to the first (left-most) element in the array. We iterate through the array and during each iteration, we expand the sorted portion of the array by one element.</p>
            <p>Upon expanding, we place the new element into its proper place within the sorted subarray. We do this by shifting all of the elements to the right until we encounter the first element we don't have to shift.</p>
            <p>For example, if in the following array the bolded part is sorted in an ascending order, the following happens:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            <p><strong>3 5 7 8</strong> 4 2 1 9 6: We take 4 and remember that that's what we need to insert. Since 8 &gt; 4, we shift.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>3 5 7 x 8</strong> 2 1 9 6: Where the value of x is not of crucial importance, since it will be overwritten immediately (either by 4 if it's its appropriate place or by 7 if we shift). Since 7 &gt; 4, we shift.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>3 5 x 7 8</strong> 2 1 9 6</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>3 x 5 7 8</strong> 2 1 9 6</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>3 4 5 7 8</strong> 2 1 9 6</p>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>After this process, the sorted portion was expanded by one element, we now have five rather than four elements. Each iteration does this and by the end we'll have the whole array sorted.</p>

            <h4 id="timecomplexity">Time Complexity</h4>
            <p>Again, we have to look at the worst case scenario for our algorithm, and it will again be the example where the whole array is descending.</p>
            <p>This is because in each iteration, we'll have to move the whole sorted list by one, which is <strong>O(n)</strong>. We have to do this for each element in every array, which means it's going to be bounded by <strong>O(n^2)</strong>.</p>
            <h3 id="selectionsort">Selection Sort</h3>
            <h4 id="explanation">Explanation</h4>
            <p>Selection Sort also divides the array into a sorted and unsorted subarray. Though, this time, the sorted subarray is formed by inserting the minimum element of the unsorted subarray at the end of the sorted array, by swapping:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            <p>3 5 <em>1</em> 2 4</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>1</strong> 5 3 <em>2</em> 4</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>1 2</strong> <em>3</em> 5 4</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>1 2 3</strong> 5 <em>4</em></p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>1 2 3 4</strong> <em>5</em></p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>1 2 3 4 5</strong></p>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="implementation">Implementation</h4>
            <p>In each iteration, we assume that the first unsorted element is the minimum and iterate through the rest to see if there's a smaller element.</p>
            <p>Once we find the current minimum of the unsorted part of the array, we swap it with the first element and consider it a part of the sorted array:</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">selectionSort</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>[] array)</span> </span>{

                            min = array[j];
                            minId = j;
                        }
                    }
                    <span class="hljs-comment">// swapping</span>
                    <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> temp = array[i];
                    array[i] = min;
                    array[minId] = temp;
                }
            }
            </code></pre>
            <h4 id="timecomplexity">Time Complexity</h4>
            <p>Finding the minimum is <strong>O(n)</strong> for the length of array because we have to check all of the elements. We have to find the minimum for each element of the array, making the whole process bounded by <strong>O(n^2)</strong>.</p>
            <h3 id="mergesort">Merge Sort</h3>
            <h4 id="explanation">Explanation</h4>
            <p>Merge Sort uses <a target="_blank" href="/understanding-recursive-functions-with-python/">recursion</a> to solve the problem of sorting more efficiently than algorithms previously presented, and in particular it uses a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm">divide and conquer</a> approach.</p>
            <p>Using both of these concepts, we'll break the whole array down into two subarrays and then:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Sort the left half of the array (recursively)</li>
            <li>Sort the right half of the array (recursively)</li>
            <li>Merge the solutions</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="lazyload-wrapper "><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/stackabuse/media/sorting-algorithms-in-java-1.png" alt="Merge Sort Illustration"></div><noscript><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/stackabuse/media/sorting-algorithms-in-java-1.png" alt="Merge Sort Illustration"/></noscript>
            <p>This tree is meant to represent how the recursive calls work. The arrays marked with the down arrow are the ones we call the function for, while we're merging the up arrow ones going back up. So you follow the down arrow to the bottom of the tree, and then go back up and merge.</p>
            <p>In our example, we have the array <code>3 5 3 2 1</code>, so we divide it into <code>3 5 4</code> and <code>2 1</code>. To sort them, we further divide them into their components. Once we've reached the bottom, we start merging up and sorting them as we go.</p>

            <p>If you'd like to read a detailed, dedicated article for <a target="_blank" href="/merge-sort-in-java/">Merge Sort</a>, we've got you covered!</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h4 id="implementation">Implementation</h4>
            <p>The core function works pretty much as laid out in the explanation. We're just passing indexes <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> which are indexes of the left-most and right-most element of the subarray we want to sort. Initially, these should be <code>0</code> and <code>array.length-1</code>, depending on implementation.</p>
            <p>The base of our recursion ensures we exit when we've finished, or when <code>right</code> and <code>left</code> meet each other. We find a midpoint <code>mid</code>, and sort subarrays left and right of it recursively, ultimately merging our solutions.</p>
            <p>If you remember our tree graphic, you might wonder why don't we create two new smaller arrays and pass them on instead. This is because on really long arrays, this would cause huge memory consumption for something that's essentially unnecessary.</p>
            <p>Merge Sort already doesn't work in-place because of the merge step, and this would only serve to worsen its memory efficiency. The logic of our tree of recursion otherwise stays the same, though, we just have to follow the indexes we're using:</p>

            <p>To merge the sorted subarrays into one, we'll need to calculate the length of each and make temporary arrays to copy them into, so we could freely change our main array.</p>
            <p>After copying, we go through the resulting array and assign it the current minimum. Because our subarrays are sorted, we just chose the lesser of the two elements that haven't been chosen so far, and move the iterator for that subarray forward:</p>

            <p>If we want to derive the complexity of recursive algorithms, we're going to have to get a little bit mathy.</p>
            <p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)">The Master Theorem</a> is used to figure out time complexity of recursive algorithms. For non-recursive algorithms, we could usually write the precise time complexity as some sort of an equation, and then we use <a target="_blank" href="/big-o-notation-and-algorithm-analysis-with-python-examples/">Big-O Notation</a> to sort them into classes of similarly-behaving algorithms.</p>
            <p>The problem with recursive algorithms is that that same equation would look something like this:</p>

            <p>The equation itself is recursive! In this equation, <code>a</code> tells us how many times we call the recursion, and <code>b</code> tells us into how many parts our problem is divided. In this case that may seem like an unimportant distinction because they're equal for mergesort, but for some problems they may not be.</p>
            <p>The rest of the equation is complexity of merging all of those solutions into one at the end. The Master Theorem solves this equation for us:</p>

                      <p>If we apply The Master Theorem, we'll see that our case is the one where <code>a=b^k</code> because we have <code>2=2^1</code>. That means our complexity is <strong>O(nlog n)</strong>. This is an extremely good time complexity for a sorting algorithm, since it has been proven that an array can't be sorted any faster than <strong>O(nlog n)</strong>.</p>
            
            
                    <p>While the version we've showcased is memory-consuming, there are more complex versions of Merge Sort that take up only <strong>O(1)</strong> space.</p>
            <p>In addition, the algorithm is extremely easy to parallelize, since recursive calls from one node can be run completely independently from separate branches. While we won't be getting into how and why, as it's beyond the scope of this article, it's worth to keep in mind the pros of using this particular algorithm.</p>
            <h3 id="heapsort">Heapsort</h3>
            <h4 id="explanation">Explanation</h4>
            <p>To properly understand why Heapsort works, you must first understand the structure it's based on - <em>the heap</em>. We'll be talking in terms of a binary heap specifically, but you can generalize most of this to other heap structures as well.</p>
            <p><em>A heap</em> is a tree that satisfies the heap property, which is that for each node, all of its children are in a given relation to it. Additionally, a heap must be almost complete. An almost complete binary tree of depth <code>d</code> has a subtree of depth <code>d-1</code> with the same root that is complete, and in which each node with a left descendent has a complete left subtree. In other words, when adding a node, we always go for the leftmost position in the highest incomplete level.</p>
            <p>If the heap is a <em>max-heap</em>, then all of the children are smaller than the parent, and if it's a <em>min-heap</em> all of them are larger.</p>
            <p>In other words, as you move down the tree, you get to smaller and smaller numbers (min-heap) or greater and greater numbers (max-heap). Here's an example of a max-heap:</p>
            <div class="lazyload-wrapper "><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/stackabuse/media/sorting-algorithms-in-java-2.png" alt="Max Heap"></div><noscript><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/stackabuse/media/sorting-algorithms-in-java-2.png" alt="Max Heap"/></noscript>
            <p>We can represent this max-heap in memory as an array in the following way:</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs">8 5 6 3 1 2 4
            </code></pre>
            <p>You can envision it as reading from the graph level by level, left to right. What we have achieved by this is that if we take the <code>kth</code> element in the array, its children's positions are <code>2*k+1</code> and <code>2*k+2</code> (assuming the indexing starts at 0). You can check this for yourself.</p>
            <p>Conversely, for the <code>kth</code> element the parent's position is always <code>(k-1)/2</code>.</p>
            <p>Knowing this, you can easily <em>"max-heapify"</em> any given array. For each element, check if any of its children are smaller than it. If they are, swap one of them with the parent, and recursively repeat this step with the parent (because the new large element might still be bigger than its other child).</p>
            <p>Leaves have no children, so they're trivially <em>max-heaps</em> of their own:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            <p>6 1 <em>8</em> 3 5 <strong>2 4</strong>: Both children are smaller than the parent, so everything stays the same.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>6 <em>1</em> 8 <strong>3 5</strong> 2 4: Because 5 &gt; 1, we swap them. We recursively heapify for 5 now.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>6 <em>5</em> 8 <strong>3 1</strong> 2 4: Both of the children are smaller, so nothing happens.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><em>6</em> <strong>5 8</strong> 3 1 2 4: Because 8 &gt; 6, we swap them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>8 5 6 3 1 2 4: We got the heap pictured above!</p>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once we've learned to heapify an array the rest is pretty simple. We swap the root of the heap with the end of the array, and shorten the array by one.</p>
            <p>We heapify the shortened array again, and repeat the process:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            <p><em>8</em> 5 6 3 1 2 <em>4</em></p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><em>4</em> 5 6 3 1 2 <strong>8</strong>: swapped</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><em>6</em> 5 4 3 1 <em>2</em> <strong>8</strong>: heapified</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>2 5 4 3 1 <strong>6 8</strong>: swapped</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><em>5</em> 2 4 2 <em>1</em> <strong>6 8</strong>: heapified</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>1 2 4 2 <strong>5 6 8</strong>: swapped</p>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>And so on, I'm sure you can see the pattern emerging.</p>

            <h4 id="timecomplexity">Time Complexity</h4>
            <p>When we look at the <code>heapify()</code> function, everything seems to be done in <strong>O(1)</strong>, but then there's that pesky recursive call.</p>
            <p>How many times will that be called, in the worst case scenario? Well, worst-case, it will propagate all the way to the top of the heap. It will do that by jumping to the parent of each node, so around the position <code>i/2</code>. that means it will make at worst <em>log n</em> jumps before it reaches the top, so the complexity is <strong>O(log n)</strong>.</p>
            <p>Because <code>heapSort()</code> is clearly <strong>O(n)</strong> due to for-loops iterating through the entire array, this would make the total complexity of Heapsort <strong>O(nlog n)</strong>.</p>
            <p>Heapsort is an in-place sort, meaning it takes <strong>O(1)</strong> additional space, as opposed to Merge Sort, but it has some drawbacks as well, such as being difficult to parallelize.</p>

            <p>Quicksort is another Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks one element of an array as the pivot and sorts all of the other elements around it, for example smaller elements to the left, and larger to the right.</p>
            <p>This guarantees that the pivot is in its proper place after the process. Then the algorithm recursively does the same for the left and right portions of the array.</p>

            <p>This turns out to be <strong>O(n^2)</strong>.</p>
            <p>This may sound bad, as we have already learned multiple algorithms which run in <strong>O(nlog n)</strong> time as their worst case, but Quicksort is actually very widely used.</p>
            <p>This is because it has a really good average runtime, also bounded by <strong>O(nlog n)</strong>, and is very efficient for a large portion of possible inputs.</p>
            <p>One of the reasons it is preferred to Merge Sort is that it doesn't take any extra space, all of the sorting is done in-place, and there's no expensive allocation and deallocation calls.</p>
            <h3 id="performancecomparison">Performance Comparison</h3>
            <p>That all being said, it's often useful to run all of these algorithms on your machine a few times to get an idea of how they perform.</p>
            <p>They'll perform differently with different collections that are being sorted of course, but even with that in mind, you should be able to notice some trends.</p>

            <p>We can evidently see that Bubble Sort is the <em>worst</em> when it comes to performance. Avoid using it in production if you can't guarantee that it'll handle only small collections and it won't stall the application.</p>
            <p>HeapSort and QuickSort are the best performance-wise. Although they're outputting similar results, QuickSort tends to be a bit better and more consistent - which checks out.</p>

            <h4 id="comparableinterface">Comparable Interface</h4>
            <p>If you have your own types, it may get cumbersome implementing a separate sorting algorithm for each one. That's why Java provides an interface allowing you to use <code>Collections.sort()</code> on your own classes.</p>
            <p>To do this, your class must implement the <code>Comparable&lt;T&gt;</code> interface, where <code>T</code> is your type, and override a method called <code>.compareTo()</code>.</p>
            <p>This method returns a negative integer if <code>this</code> is smaller than the argument element, 0 if they're equal, and a positive integer if <code>this</code> is greater.</p>
            <p>In our example, we've made a class <code>Student</code>, and each student is identified by an <code>id</code> and a year they started their studies.</p>
            <p>We want to sort them primarily by generations, but also secondarily by IDs:</p>

            <h3 id="countingsort">Counting Sort</h3>
            
<p>Counting Sort is a stable, non-comparative sorting algorithm, and it's main use is for sorting arrays of non-negative integers.</p>
<p>Counting Sort counts the number of objects that have distinct key values, and then applying a prefix sum on those counts to determine the position of each key in the output. Like all other <strong>non-comparative</strong> sorting algorithms, Counting Sort also performs the sort without any comparisons between the elements to be sorted. Also, being a <strong>stable</strong> sorting algorithm, Counting Sort preserves the order of the elements with equal keys sorted in the output array as they were in the original array.</p>
<p>This operation results in, essentially, a list of integer occurrences, which we typically name the <em>count array</em>. Counting Sort uses the auxilliary <em>count array</em> to determine the positions of elements:</p>
<div class="lazyload-wrapper "><img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://s3.stackabuse.com/media/articles/radix-sort-in-python-2.png" alt="img"></div><noscript><img src="https://s3.stackabuse.com/media/articles/radix-sort-in-python-2.png" alt="img"/></noscript><p></p>
<p>Each <em>index</em> in the count array represents an <em>element</em> in the input array. The value associated with this index is the number of occurrences (the count) of the element in the input array.</p>
<p>The best way to get a feel of how Counting Sort works is by going through an example. Consider we have an array:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>[] arr = {<span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">8</span>, <span class="hljs-number">4</span>, <span class="hljs-number">7</span>, <span class="hljs-number">9</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">7</span>};
</code></pre>
<p>For simplicity's sake, the elements in the array will only be single digits, that is numbers from <code>0</code> through <code>9</code>. Since the largest value we can have is <code>9</code>, let's label the maximum value as <code>max = 9</code>.</p>
<p>This is important because we'll need to designate a new count array, consisting of <code>max + 1</code> elements. This array will be used for counting the number of occurrences of every digit within our original array we're given to sort, so we need to initialize the whole count array to <code>0</code>, that is:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>[] countArray = {<span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>};
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Since there are 10 possible elements our array can have, there are ten zero's for every single digit.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since we've defined the array we'll be working on, and we have also defined our count  array to keep count of each occurrence of a digit, we need to go through the following step to make Counting Sort work:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>By going through our whole array <code>arr</code> in a single <code>for</code> loop, for every <code>i</code> from <code>0</code> to <code>n-1</code>, where <code>n</code> is the number of elements in <code>arr</code>, we'll count the occurrence of each digit by incrementing the value on the position <code>arr[i]</code> in our <code>countArray</code>. Let's see that in code:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; arr.length; i++)
    countArray[arr[i]]++;
</code></pre>
<p>After the first step, our <code>countArray</code> looks like this: <strong>[1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1]</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>Since we now have our <code>countArray</code> filled with values, we go on to the next step - applying prefix sums to the <code>countArray</code>. Prefix sums are basically formed when we add each of the previous numbers in the array onto the next accumulatively, forming a sum of all yet seen prefixes:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i=<span class="hljs-number">1</span>; i &lt; countArray.length; i++)
    countArray[i] += countArray[i-<span class="hljs-number">1</span>];
</code></pre>
<p>And after applying this step we get the following <code>countArray</code>: <strong>[1, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 7, 8]</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>The third and last step is calculating the element positions in the sorted output based off the values in the <code>countArray</code>. For this purpose, we'll need a new array that we'll call <code>outputArray</code>. The size of the <code>outputArray</code> is the same as our original <code>arr</code>, and we once again initialize this array to all zeros:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>[] outputArray = {<span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>};
</code></pre>
<p>As we've mentioned earlier, Counting Sort is a <em>stable</em> sort. If we iterated through our <code>arr</code> array from <code>0</code> to <code>n-1</code> we may end up switching the elements around and ruin the stability of this sorting algorithm, so we iterate the array in the reverse order.</p>
<p>We'll find the index in our <code>countArray</code> that is equal to the value of the current element <code>arr[i]</code>. Then, at the position <code>countArray[arr[i]] - 1</code> we'll place the element <code>arr[i]</code>. This guarantees we keep the stability of this sort. Afterwards, we decrement the value <code>countArray[i]</code> by one, and continue on doing the same until <code>i &gt;= 0</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i = arr.length-<span class="hljs-number">1</span>; i &gt;= <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i--){
    outputArray[countArray[arr[i]] - <span class="hljs-number">1</span>] = arr[i];
    countArray[arr[i]]--;
}
</code></pre>
<p>At the end of the algorithm, we can just copy the values from <code>outputArr</code> into our starting array <code>arr</code> and print the sorted array out:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; arr.length; i++){
    arr[i] = outputArray[i];
    System.out.print(arr[i] + <span class="hljs-string">" "</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Running of course gives us the sorted array with guaranteed stability (relative order) of equal elements:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">0 1 1 4 7 7 8 9
</code></pre>
<h3 id="complexityofcountingsort">Complexity of Counting Sort</h3>
<p>Let's discuss both the <em>time and space complexity</em> of Counting Sort.</p>
<p>Let's say that <code>n</code> is the number of elements in the <code>arr</code> array, and <code>k</code> is the range of allowed values for those <code>n</code> elements from <code>1...n</code>. As we're working only with simple <code>for</code> loops, without any recursive calls, we can analyze the <strong>time complexity</strong> in a following manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counting the occurrence of each element in our input range takes <code>O(n)</code> time,</li>
<li>Calculating the prefix sums takes up <code>O(k)</code> time,</li>
<li>And calculating the <code>outputArray</code> based off the previous two takes <code>O(n)</code> time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Accounting for all the complexities of these individual steps, the time complexity of Counting Sort is <code>O(n+k)</code>, making Counting Sort's average case linear, which is better than most comparison based sorting algorithms. However, if the range of <code>k</code> is <code>1...n²</code>, the worst-case of Counting Sorts quickly deteriorates to <code>O(n²)</code> which is <em>really bad</em>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this doesn't happen often, and there <em>is</em> a way to ensure that it <em>never happens</em>. This is how <em>Radix Sort</em> came to be - which typically uses Counting Sort as its main subroutine while sorting.</p>
<p>By employing Counting Sort on multiple bounded subarrays, the time complexity <em>never</em> deteriorates to <code>O(n²)</code>. Additionally, Radix Sort may use any stable, non-comparative algorithm instead of Counting Sort, but it's the most commonly used one.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the <strong>space complexity</strong> problem is much easier. Since our <code>countArray</code> of size <code>k</code> is bigger than our starting array of <code>n</code> elements, the dominating complexity there will be <code>O(k)</code>. Important thing to note is that, the larger the range of elements in the given array, larger is the space complexity of Counting Sort.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>Sorting is one of the fundamental techniques used in solving problems, especially in those related to writing and implementing efficient algorithms.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Usually, sorting is paired with searching - meaning we first sort elements in the given collection, then search for something within it, as it is <strong>generally</strong> easier to search for something in a sorted, rather than an unsorted collection, as we can make educated guesses and impose assumptions on the data.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>There are many algorithms that can efficiently sort elements, but in this guide we'll be taking a look at how to implement <strong>Radix Sort</strong> in Java.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3 id="radixsortinjava">Radix Sort in Java</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Radix Sort</em></strong> is a non-comparative sorting algorithm, meaning it doesn't sort a collection by comparing each of the elements within it, but instead relies on something called the <strong><em>radix</em></strong> to sort the collection.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>The <strong><em>radix</em></strong> (often called the <strong>base</strong>) is the number of unique digits in a positional numeric system, used to represent numbers.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>For the well-known binary system, the radix is 2 (it uses only two digits - 0 and 1). For the arguably even more well-known decimal system, the radix is 10 (it uses ten digits to represent all numbers - from 0 to 9).</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>How does Radix Sort use this to its advantage?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Radix Sort doesn't sort by itself, really. It uses any stable, non-comparative sorting algorithm as its subroutine - and in most cases, the subroutine is <strong>Counting Sort</strong>.</p>
  <div class="lazyload-wrapper "><img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://s3.stackabuse.com/media/articles/radix-sort-in-python-1.png" alt="stable sorting"></div><noscript><img src="https://s3.stackabuse.com/media/articles/radix-sort-in-python-1.png" alt="stable sorting"/></noscript>
  <p>If <code>n</code> represents the number of elements we are to sort, and <code>k</code> is the range of allowed values for those elements, Counting Sort's time complexity is <code>O(n+k)</code> when <code>k</code> is in range from <code>1...n</code>, which is significantly faster than the typical comparative sorting algorithm with a time complexity of <code>O(nlogn)</code>.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>But the problem here is - if the range is <code>1...n²</code>, the time complexity drastically deteriorates to <code>O(n²)</code> very quickly.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The general idea of Radix Sort is to sort digit by digit from the least significant ones to the most significant (<strong><em>LSD Radix Sort</em></strong>) and you can also go the other way around (<em><strong>MSD Radix Sort</strong></em>). It allows Counting Sort to do its best by partitioning the input and running Counting Sort multiple times on sets that don't let <code>k</code> approach <code>n²</code>.</p>
  <p>Because it's not comparison based, it's not bounded by <code>O(nlogn)</code> - it can even perform in linear time.</p>
  <p>Since the heavy lifting is done by Counting Sort, let's first go ahead and take a look at how it works and implement it, before diving into Radix Sort itself!</p>
  <h4 id="countingsortinjavatheoryandimplementation">Counting Sort in Java - Theory and Implementation</h4>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Counting Sort is a <em>non-comparative</em>, <em>stable</em> sorting algorithm, and it's main use is for sorting arrays of integers.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The way it works is, it counts the number of objects having distinct key values, and then applying a prefix sum on those same counts to determine the position of each key value in the output. Being <em>stable</em>, the order of records with equal keys is preserved when the collection is sorted.</p>
  <p>This operation results in, essentially, a list of integer occurrences, which we typically name the <em>count array</em>. Counting Sort uses the auxilliary <em>count array</em> to determine the positions of elements:</p>
  <div class="lazyload-wrapper "><img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://s3.stackabuse.com/media/articles/radix-sort-in-python-2.png" alt=""></div><noscript><img src="https://s3.stackabuse.com/media/articles/radix-sort-in-python-2.png" alt=""/></noscript>
  <p>Each <em>index</em> in the output array represents an <em>element</em> in the input array. The value associated with this index is the number of occurences (the count) of the element in the input array.</p>
  <p>The best way to show how Counting Sort works is through an example. Consider we have the following array:</p>
  <pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>[] arr = {<span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">8</span>, <span class="hljs-number">7</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>};
  </code></pre>
  <p>For the sake of simplicity, we'll be using digits from <em>0</em> through <em>9</em>. The maximum value of a digit we can take into consideration is obviously <em>9</em>, so we'll set a <code>max = 9</code>.</p>
  <p>This is important because we need an additional, auxilliary array consisting of <code>max + 1</code> elements. This array will be used to count the number of appearances of every digit within our array <code>arr</code>, so we need to initialize the whole counting array <code>countingArray</code> to <code>0</code>.</p>
  
  <pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>[] countingArray = {<span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>};
  <span class="hljs-comment">// there are 10 digits, so one zero for every element</span>
  </code></pre>
  <p>Now that we've both defined the array we'll be working with and initialized the counting array, we need to do the following steps to <em>implement</em> Counting Sort:</p>
  <p><strong>1.</strong> Traversing through our <code>arr</code> array, and counting the occurrence of every single element while incrementing the element on the position <code>arr[i]</code> in our <code>countingArray</code> array:</p>
  <pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; arr.length; i++)
      countingArray[arr[i]]++;
  </code></pre>
  <p>After this step, <code>countingArray</code> has the following elements: <code>[1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0]</code>.</p>
  <p><strong>2.</strong> The next step is applying prefix sums on the <code>countingArray</code>, and we get the following:</p>
  <pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i=<span class="hljs-number">1</span>; i &lt; countingArray.length; i++)
      countingArray[i] += countingArray[i-<span class="hljs-number">1</span>];
  </code></pre>
  <p>After the modification of the counting array it now consists of <code>countingArray = {1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8}</code>.</p>
  <p><strong>3.</strong> The third and last step is to calculate element positions in the sorted output based of the values in <code>countingArray</code>. For that we'll need a new array that we'll call <code>outputArray</code>, and we'll initialize it to <code>m</code> zeros, where <code>m</code> is the number of elements in our original array <code>arr</code>:</p>
  <pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>[] outputArray = {<span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>};
  <span class="hljs-comment">// there are 8 elements in the arr array</span>
  </code></pre>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Since Counting Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, we'll be iterating through the <code>arr</code> array in reverse order, lest we end up switching the elements.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>We'll find the index in our <code>countingArray</code> that is equal to the value of the current element <code>arr[i]</code>. Then, at the position <code>countingArray[arr[i]] - 1</code> we'll place the element <code>arr[i]</code>.</p>
  <p>This guarantees the stability of this sort, as well as placing every element in it's right position in the sorted order. Afterwards, we'll decrement the value of <code>countingArray[i]</code> by 1.</p>
 <p>At the end, we'll be copying the the <code>outputArray</code> to <code>arr</code> so that the sorted elements are contained within <code>arr</code> now.</p>
  <p>Let's unify all of these snippets and completely implement Counting Sort:</p>
  <pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>[] arr = {<span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">8</span>, <span class="hljs-number">7</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>};
  <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>[] countingArray = {<span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>};
  
  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; arr.length; i++)
      countingArray[arr[i]]++;
  
  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i=<span class="hljs-number">1</span>; i &lt; countingArray.length; i++)
    countingArray[i] += countingArray[i-<span class="hljs-number">1</span>];
  
  <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>[] outputArray = {<span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>};
  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i = arr.length-<span class="hljs-number">1</span>; i &gt;= <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i--){
      outputArray[countingArray[arr[i]] - <span class="hljs-number">1</span>] = arr[i];
      countingArray[arr[i]]--;
  }
  
  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; arr.length; i++){
      arr[i] = outputArray[i];
      System.out.print(arr[i] + <span class="hljs-string">" "</span>);
  }
  </code></pre>
  <p>Running this will give us a sorted array:</p>
  <pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>, <span class="hljs-number">7</span>, <span class="hljs-number">8</span>
  </code></pre>
  <p>As mentioned earlier, the time complexity of this algorithm is <code>O(n+k)</code> where <code>n</code> is the number of elements in <code>arr</code>, and <code>k</code> is the value of <code>max</code> element in the array. However, as <code>k</code> approaches <code>n²</code> this algorithm deteriorates towards <code>O(n²)</code>, which is a major downside of the algorithm.</p>
  <p>Since we've briefly explained how Counting Sort works, let's move on to the main topic of this article - Radix Sort.</p>
  <h4 id="radixsortinjavatheoryandimplementation">Radix Sort in Java - Theory and Implementation</h4>
  <p>Again, Radix Sort typically Counting Sort as a subroutine, so Radix Sort itself is a stable sorting algorithm as well.</p>
  <p>The keys used by the Counting Sort will be the digits of the integers within the array we're sorting.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>There are two variants of Radix Sort - one that sorts from the <strong>Least Significant Digit (LSD)</strong>, and the second one that sorts from the <strong>Most Significant Digit (MSD)</strong> - we'll be focusing on the LSD approach.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Radix Sort by itself isn't very complicated to understand once we understand how Counting Sort works, so the steps taken to implement it are fairly simple:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Find the <code>max</code> element in the input array.</li>
  <li>Determine the number of digits, <code>d</code>, the <code>max</code> element has. The number <code>d</code> represents how many times we'll go through the array using Counting Sort to sort it.</li>
  <li>Initialize the number <code>s</code> to 1 at the beginning, representing the least significant place and working it's value up by multiplying it by 10 every time.</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
  <p>For example, let's say we have the following input array <code>arr = {73, 481, 57, 23, 332, 800, 754, 125}</code>. The number of times we'll loop through the array is 3, since the <code>max</code> element in our <code>arr</code> array is 800, which has 3 digits.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Let's go through a visual example of an array being sorted this way, step by step, to see how Radix Sort sorts the elements in each iteration:</p>
  <p></p><div class="lazyload-wrapper "><img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://s3.stackabuse.com/media/articles/radix-sort-in-python-3.png" alt=""></div><noscript><img src="https://s3.stackabuse.com/media/articles/radix-sort-in-python-3.png" alt=""/></noscript><p></p>
  <p>The input array is broken down into the digits that make up its original elemments. Then - either using by the most significant digit and working our way down, or the least significant digit and working our way up, the sequence is sorted via Counting Sort:</p>
  <div class="lazyload-wrapper "><img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://s3.stackabuse.com/media/articles/radix-sort-in-python-4.png" alt=""></div><noscript><img src="https://s3.stackabuse.com/media/articles/radix-sort-in-python-4.png" alt=""/></noscript>
  <p>In the first pass, only the right-hand side is used to sort, and this is why stability in Radix Sort/Counting Sort are key. If there was no stability, there would be no point in sorting this way. In the second pass, we use the middle row, and finally - the left-hand row is used, and the array is fully sorted.</p>
  <p>Finally, let's implement Radix Sort:</p>
  <pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">radixSort</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>[] arr)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> max = arr[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>];
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {
      <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (max &lt; arr[i])
        max = arr[i];
    }
  
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> s = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>; max / s &gt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; s *= <span class="hljs-number">10</span>)
      countingSortForRadix(arr, s);
  }
  </code></pre>
  <p>We'll also want to sligthly modify Countinng Sort.</p>
  <p>This modification of Counting Sort does the exact same thing as the previous implementation, only it focuses on digits in different places of the integers at a time:</p>
  <pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">countingSortForRadix</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>[] arr, <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> s)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>[] countingArray = {<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>};
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; arr.length; i++)
      countingArray[(arr[i] / s) % <span class="hljs-number">10</span>]++;
  
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>; i &lt; <span class="hljs-number">10</span>; i++)
      countingArray[i] += countingArray[i - <span class="hljs-number">1</span>];
  
    <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>[] outputArray = {<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>};
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i = arr.length - <span class="hljs-number">1</span>; i &gt;= <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i--)
      outputArray[--countingArray[(arr[i] / s) % <span class="hljs-number">10</span>]] = arr[i];
  
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; arr.length; i++)
      arr[i] = outputArray[i];
  }
  </code></pre>
  <p>Let's create an array and try sorting it now:</p>
  <pre><code class="hljs">public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] arr = {73,481,57,23,332,800,754,125};
  
    radixSort(arr);
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++)
      System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
  }
  </code></pre>
  <p>This results in:</p>
  <pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-number">23</span>, <span class="hljs-number">57</span>, <span class="hljs-number">73</span>, <span class="hljs-number">125</span>, <span class="hljs-number">332</span>, <span class="hljs-number">481</span>, <span class="hljs-number">754</span>, <span class="hljs-number">800</span>
  </code></pre>
  <p>Since we are using Counting Sort as the main subroutine, for an array containing <code>n</code> elements, that has the <code>max</code> element with <code>d</code> digits, in a system with a <code>b</code> base, we have the time complexity of <code>O(d(n+b))</code>.</p>
  <p>That's because we're repeating the Counting Sort process <code>d</code> times, which has <code>O(n+b)</code> complexity.</p>
  <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Although Radix Sort can run very efficiently and wonderfully, it requires some specific cases to do so. Because it requires that you represent the items to be sorted as integers, it's easy to see why some other comparison-based sorting algorithms can prove to be a better choice in many cases.</p>
  <p>The additional memory requirements of Radix Sort compared to some other comparison based algorithms is also one of the reasons that this sorting algorithm is used more rarely than not.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, this algorithm performs superbly when the input array has shorter keys, or the range of elements is smaller.</p>
  </div>





<br><h3 id="bucketsort">Bucket Sort</h3>

The idea of <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2017/01/bucket-sort-in-java-with-example.html#axzz58bLA7tAs" target="_blank">bucket sort</a> is quite simple, you distribute the elements of an array into a number of buckets and then sort those individual buckets by a different sorting algorithm or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm.<br>
<br>
You might have remembered, how shopkeepers or bank cashiers used to prepare/sort bundles of notes. They usually have a bucket load of cash with different denominations like 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100. They just put all 5 Rs notes into one place, all Rs 10 notes into another place, and so on.<br>
<br>
This way all notes are sorted in <span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">O(n)</span> time because you don't need to sort individual buckets, they are all same notes there.<br>
<br>
Anyway, for bucket sort to work at its super fast speed, there are multiple prerequisites. First, the hash function that is used to partition the elements must be very good and must produce an ordered hash: if the&nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">i &lt; j</span> then <span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">hash(i) &lt; hash(j)</span>.<br>
<br>
If this is not the case then you cannot concatenate individual buckets in O(n) time. Second, the elements to be sorted must be <b>uniformly distributed. </b>If you still have trouble understanding Bucket sort or want to explore other linear time sorting algorithms, <br>


<br>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
Difference between Bucket Sort vs Counting Sort</h3>
If you keep these prerequisites aside,&nbsp;<b>bucket sort</b>&nbsp;is actually very good considering that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.java67.com/2017/06/counting-sort-in-java-example.html" target="_blank">counting sort&nbsp;</a>is reasonably equal to its upper bound and counting sort is also super fast.<br>
<br>
The particular distinction for bucket sort is that it uses a hash function to partition the keys of the input array, so that multiple keys may hash to the same bucket.&nbsp; Hence each bucket must effectively be a growable list; similar to <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/03/how-to-implement-radix-sort-in-java.html" target="_blank">Radix sort</a>, another O(n) sorting algorithm.<br>
<div>
<br></div>
Many programmers get confused between Counting Sort and Bucket sort as they work quite similarly, but the most important difference between them is that Bucket sort uses a hash function to distribute keys while Counting sort creates a bucket for each key.<br>
<br>
In our example, I have used JDK's <span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">Collections.sort()</span> method to sort each bucket. This is to indicate that the bucket sort algorithm does not specify which sorting algorithm should be used to sort individual buckets.<br>
<br>
A programmer may choose to recursively use bucket sort on each bucket until the input array is sorted, similar to radix sort. Anyway, whichever sorting method you use to sort individual buckets, the time complexity of bucket sort will still tend towards <span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">O(n)</span>.<br>
<br>
I think there are perhaps greater similarities between the radix sort and bucket sort than there are between the counting sort and bucket sort. <br>

<br>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
Bucket Sort - FAQ</h3>
Now, let's see some of the frequently asked questions about Bucket sort in programming job interviews.<br>
<br>
<b>1. Is the bucket sort, a stable algorithm?</b><br>
Bucket sort is not a stable sorting algorithm. If you remember, &nbsp;A sorting algorithm is said to be <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/06/difference-between-stable-and-unstable-algorithm.html" target="_blank">stable </a>if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input array to be sorted. Some sorting algorithms are stable by nature like <a href="http://www.java67.com/2014/09/insertion-sort-in-java-with-example.html">Insertion sort</a>, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/03/mergesort-in-java-algorithm-example-and.html" target="_blank">Merge Sort</a>, or <a href="http://www.java67.com/2012/12/bubble-sort-in-java-program-to-sort-integer-array-example.html">Bubble Sort</a>, etc. In the case of Bucket sort, input sorts themselves by moving into a bucket and their order are not guaranteed to be retained.<br>
<br>
<b><br></b><b>2. Is the bucket sort in-place algorithm?</b><br>
Bucket sort is also not an <a href="http://www.java67.com/2016/01/java-program-to-reverse-array-in-place.html">in-place sorting algorithm</a> because you create buckets that can be array, linked list, or hashtable and they take additional spaces. In the worst of the good cases (sequential values, but no repetition) the additional space needed is as big as the original array.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>3. What is the time complexity of Bucket sort?</b><br>
The time complexity of bucket sort in the <span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">O(n)</span> in the best and average case and <span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">O(n^2)</span> in the worst case. The creation of bucket will take O(1) time and assume moving elements into the bucket will take O(1) time e.g. in the case of <a href="http://www.java67.com/2013/06/how-get-method-of-hashmap-or-hashtable-works-internally.html">hashtable</a> and <a href="http://www.java67.com/2016/01/how-to-implement-singly-linked-list-in-java-using-generics-example.html">linked list</a>.<br>
<br>
The main step is to sort elements on individual elements. This step also takes O(n) time on average if all numbers are uniformly distributed (please refer&nbsp;to <a href="https://www.java67.com/2015/09/top-10-algorithm-books-every-programmer-read-learn.html" target="_blank">CLRS book</a> for more details). The last step to concatenate all buckets will also take O(n) time as there will be n items in all buckets

<br>
<br>
<b>4. What is the time complexity of Bucket sort in the worst case?</b><br>

<b>5. What is the space complexity of Bucket sort?</b><br>
The space complexity of the bucket sort algorithm is O(n) because even in the worst of the good cases (sequential values, but no repetition) the additional space needed is as big as the original array.

3) You can use a <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2015/02/simple-junit-example-unit-tests-for-linked-list-java.html" target="_blank">linked list</a> or <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2013/11/java-array-101-for-programmers-and.html" target="_blank">array</a> as a bucket. The choice of data structure will affect the insertion time e.g. if you use a linked list then adding on the head could take O(1) time. You can also use hash tables as buckets.<br>
<br>
4) The bucket sort is one of the rare <span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">O(n)</span> sorting algorithms i.e. time complexity of Bucket sort is the liner in the best and average case and not <span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">NLogN</span> like <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2016/09/iterative-quicksort-example-in-java-without-recursion.html">Quicksort</a> or <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/05/top-75-programming-interview-questions-answers.html" target="_blank">Mergesort</a>.<br>
<br>
5) Bucket sort is not a stable sorting algorithm because in a stable algorithm if two input is same they retain their place in sorted order and in the bucket it depends upon how you sort the individual bucket. However, bucket sort can be made stable, known as radix sort, which we'll see in future articles.<br>

6) You can sort the elements inside individual buckets either by recursively <span class="vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default"><span class="vm-hook" style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0); cursor: pointer;">calling</span><svg class="vm-hook-icon" width="10px" height="10px" viewBox="0 0 338 301" style="display: inline-block;"><path d="M137.996535,223.44073 L301.3926,60.0435213 L302.601093,61.2514423 L301.008651,104.392132 C300.913093,109.117959 304.717673,113.000358 309.444643,113.000358 L328.959634,113.000358 C333.619657,113.000358 337.397343,109.222672 337.397343,104.562649 L337.499195,8.93833461 C337.499195,4.27831154 333.72151,0.500625849 329.061487,0.500625849 L233.437172,0.602478023 C228.777149,0.602478023 224.999464,4.38016372 224.999464,9.04018679 L224.999464,28.5546056 C224.999464,33.2815764 228.881862,37.0867279 233.607689,36.9905977 L276.747807,35.3981562 L277.955728,36.6066494 L114.559091,200.003286 C111.81366,202.749289 111.81366,207.20103 114.559091,209.947034 L128.052788,223.44073 C130.799363,226.186161 135.251104,226.186161 137.996535,223.44073 Z M234.374441,300.499911 C249.90747,300.499911 262.499374,287.908006 262.499374,272.374978 L262.499374,142.42877 C262.499374,136.164861 254.925692,133.027471 250.496267,137.457468 L236.433801,151.519934 C235.297405,152.65633 234.374441,154.883917 234.374441,156.491236 L234.374441,268.859361 C234.374441,270.799702 232.799166,272.374978 230.858825,272.374978 L31.6405496,272.374978 C29.7002084,272.374978 28.1249329,270.799702 28.1249329,268.859361 L28.1249329,69.641086 C28.1249329,67.7007449 29.7002084,66.1254694 31.6405496,66.1254694 L208.578948,66.1254694 C214.843429,66.1254694 217.980819,58.5517875 213.550821,54.1223623 L199.488355,40.0598959 C198.351387,38.9235002 196.124372,38.0005364 194.516481,38.0005364 L28.1249329,38.0005364 C12.5919042,38.0005364 0,50.5924406 0,66.1254694 L0,272.374978 C0,287.908006 12.5919042,300.499911 28.1249329,300.499911 L234.374441,300.499911 Z" style="fill: rgb(0, 153, 0);"></path></svg></span> the bucket sort or using a separate sorting algorithm like&nbsp;<a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2014/12/insertion-sort-algorithm-in-java-to-array-example.html" target="_blank">insertion sort</a>, <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2014/08/bubble-sort-algorithm-in-java-with.html" target="_blank">bubble sort</a>, or <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2014/08/quicksort-sorting-algorithm-in-java-in-place-example.html" target="_blank">quicksort</a>.<br>

<br>
8) The worst-case complexity of bucket sort, when all elements will end up in the same bucket is <span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">O(n^2)</span> because then it has to be sorted by a different sorting algorithm.<br>

That's all about <b>bucket sort in Java</b>. It's one of the interesting sorting algorithms which gives you O(n) performance in the best and average case.

It is also not an in-place algorithm, as it will require additional space as big as the original array in the worst case.

<br><h3 id="shellsort">Shell Sort</h3><br>

<p>Most sorting algorithms compare elements, in our case numbers, which are near each other in some way. An example would be <em>Bubble Sort</em>, which compares adjacent elements and swaps them if needed. Shell Sort utilizes a completely different approach, comparing elements that are further apart in the beginning. Though, the further we sort, the closer they become.</p>
<p>The space between elements we are comparing (known as the <em>gap</em>) in the beginning can be given as one of the arguments when calling the algorithm. <em>Shell Sort</em> is considered to be a generalization of <em>Insertion Sort</em>, so it's useful to quickly draw a parallel between the two and recap Insertion Sort just in case.</p>
<h4 id="parallelswithinsertionsort">Parallels with Insertion Sort</h4>
<p>Insertion Sort places elements of a collection in their ordered place one at a time by selecting an element and comparing it with each element with a lower index. Once it finds the correct place for the current element, it's placed and the process repeats.</p>
<p>Here's a code snippet that should illustrate how Insertion Sort works. The whole collection is shifted to the right in the correct place to "free up" space for an element to be inserted.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">insertionSort</span><span class="hljs-params">(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; arr,<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> n)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i, j, newValue;

    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (i = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>; i &lt; n; i++) {
        newValue = arr.get(i);
        j = i;

        <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> (j &gt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span> &amp;&amp; arr.get(j-<span class="hljs-number">1</span>) &gt; newValue) {
            arr.set(j,arr.get(j-<span class="hljs-number">1</span>));
            j--;
        }
        arr.set(j,newValue);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Shell Sort takes the insertion approach, but instead of assigning it its exact position, in each iteration it brings elements just closer to their place. Each pass will look a little more sorted, until it finally is.</p>
<p>To understand how this works, we must first explain what is a K-sorted array and what are its characteristics.</p>
<h4 id="ksortedarray">K-Sorted Array</h4>
<p>Suppose <code>A</code> is an array of a size N. Array <code>A</code> is K-sorted if every element is, at most, K places away from its target position. In other words, for each <code>i</code> between 1 and N, the target place of <code>A[i]</code> is somewhere between <code>i-K</code> and <code>1+K</code> in <code>A</code>.</p>
<p>For an unsorted, N-sized array, it is possible to K-sort it in <em>O(N logK)</em> time.</p>
<p>An important property of K-sorted arrays is that if K<sub>1</sub> sorted array is K<sub>2</sub>-sorted, it stays K<sub>1</sub> sorted. This can easily be proven.</p>

<h4 id="shellsortexample">Shell Sort Example</h4>
<p>Unlike in Insertion Sort, where whenever we make a swap the collection is shifted to the right, in Shell Sort the elements whose positions we change get grouped together and then get sorted within the groups. After the groups are sorted, only then are they shifted, resulting is much less moving of the actual elements themselves.</p>

gap = [\frac{11}{2}] = 5. 
</script></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: 7, 13, 18, 22, 8, 29, 14, 7, 27, 25, 3</p>
<p>Now, we make groups of numbers that are 5 elements apart (have 4 elements between them). The groups are (7, 29, 3), (13, 14), (18, 7), (22, 27), (8, 25).</p>
<p>Since <code>N/2</code> is used for the initial <em>gap</em> value, the first group has 3 elements, and others have two elements each due to the fact our collection has an uneven number of elements.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: <strong>7</strong>, 13, 18, 22, 8, <strong>29</strong>, 14, 7, 27, 25, <strong>3</strong></p>
<p>There are no elements in the first group with smaller index than 0, so we are starting from second index - whose value is 29. The next step is to compare 29 to all the elements in the group with smaller indexes.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>7 &lt; 29</em> is true so their places will not be swapped.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no other elements in the group with an index lower than 5, so we are finished with <code>A[5]</code>.</p>
<p>The next number in the group is 3, whose original index is 10:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>29 &lt; 3</em> is false so they will be swapped:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A</strong>: <strong>7</strong>, 13, 18, 22, 8, <strong>3</strong>, 14, 7, 27, 25, <strong>29</strong></p>
<p>Now, the value of <code>A[5]</code> is 3. 29 must be on its ordered place in the group, because there is no element with greater index in that group. 3, on the other hand, might still be smaller than group members with lower indexes.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>7 &lt; 3</em> is false, so they will be swapped:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A</strong>: <strong>3</strong>, 13, 18, 22, 8, <strong>7</strong>, 14, 7, 27, 25, <strong>29</strong></p>
<p>There are no elements in <code>A</code> with a lower index than 10 that we haven't already compared to <code>A[10]</code>. All the members of the first group are now sorted.</p>
<p>The next group is (13, 14):</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: 3, <strong>13</strong>, 18, 22, 8, 7, <strong>14</strong>, 7, 27, 25, 29</p>
<p>It is easy to notice that if there are only two elements in the group, they are swapped only if the first one is bigger that the second one. The groups that are left now are (18, 7), (22, 27), and (8, 25) and the only group that will need swapping will be (18, 7):</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: 3, 13, <strong>7</strong>, 22, 8, 7, 14, <strong>18</strong>, 27, 25, 29</p>
<p>At this point there are no groups left to analyze, so the array is <em>5-sorted</em>. Although looking better than before, it's still not quite finished.</p>
<p>Now, the <em>gap</em> is divided by two yet again:</p>

gap = [\frac{5}{2}] = 2 
</script></p>
<p>Now, we make groups of elements that are just 2 elements apart, which means that there is only one element between them. These groups are (3, 7, 8, 14, 27, 29) and (13, 22, 7, 18, 25):</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: <strong>3</strong>, 13, <strong>7</strong>, 22, <strong>8</strong>, 7, <strong>14</strong>, 18, <strong>27</strong>, 25, <strong>29</strong></p>
<p>Sorting when <em>gap</em> is 2 will be displayed on the 2-sorting of the second group.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: 3, <strong>13</strong>, 7, <strong>22</strong>, 8, <strong>7</strong>, 14, <strong>18</strong>, 27, <strong>25</strong>, 29</p>
<p>These two groups are sorted in the same way the previous groups were sorted, and we're left with:</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: 3, <strong>7</strong>, 7, <strong>13</strong>, 8, <strong>18</strong>, 14, <strong>22</strong>, 27, <strong>25</strong>, 29</p>
<p>The last thing left to do is to 1-sort the array, which is, actually Insertion Sort.</p>
<p>Every member is compared to all other elements with smaller indexes. The important thing to notice here is that array is already 2-sorted, so it is only possible that elements on places <code>i</code> and <code>i+1</code> are not ordered. Therefore, when 1-sorting, only elements next to each other can be swapped.</p>
<h4 id="implementation">Implementation</h4>
<p>With all of the above in mind, let's implement Shell Sort. The loop invariant in the main <code>for</code> loop is that the array is gap-sorted. The <code>gap</code> is halved on every iteration until it reaches 0. When it does, the array is sorted:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">shSort</span><span class="hljs-params">(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; arr,<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> n)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> gap = n/<span class="hljs-number">2</span>; gap &gt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; gap /= <span class="hljs-number">2</span>) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i = gap; i &lt; n; i+= <span class="hljs-number">1</span>) {

            <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> temp = arr.get(i);
            <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> j;
            <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (j = i; j &gt;= gap &amp;&amp; arr.get(j-gap) &gt; temp; j -= gap)
                arr.set(j,arr.get(j-gap));
            arr.set(j,temp);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The array and its size are given as arguments of the method and the loop gets executed <em>log<sub>n</sub></em> times.</p>
<p>The first nested <code>for</code> loop goes through groups of elements that are <code>gap</code> places apart. That loop gets executed <code>n-gap</code> times. The <code>temp</code> variable is necessary for swapping, as usual.</p>
<p>One of the conditions in the second nested <code>for</code> loop is that <code>j &gt; gap</code>, because we are comparing an element to all members of the group with smaller indexes from right to left.</p>
<p>Due to this, the last number that will be observed will be the first member of the group. The second condition is that <code>j-gap &lt; temp</code>. This means that the loop is being executed while there are elements with lower indexes that are bigger than <code>arr[j]</code>.</p>
<p>The first one that is lower breaks the loop. Then, <code>arr[j]</code> gets moved to the index whose value it was smaller than. This loop repeats <code>i/gap</code> times.</p>
<h3 id="timecomplexity">Time Complexity</h3>
<p>Let us now calculate the time complexity of Shell Sort. As was already mentioned, the first loop is executed <em>log<sub>n</sub></em> times.</p>
<p>The second loop starts with <code>gap</code> as the index, which is 2<sup>k</sup>. Since in the third loop we subtract <code>gap</code>, that means that in the sum, <code>i</code> should be divided by <code>gap</code>:</p>

<p>This all brings the time complexity to <em>O(n logn)</em>. Here, we assumed the fact that <code>gap</code> is set to <code>n/2</code>.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Shell Sort compares elements that are further apart in the beginning, though, the further we sort, the closer they become resulting in an array that's a bit more sorted after each iteration.</p>
<p>Shell Sort performs better than Insertion Sort but it has a bigger cache miss ratio than Quick Sort.</p>

            <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Sorting is a very common operation with datasets, whether it is to analyze them further, speed up search by using more efficient algorithms that rely on the data being sorted, filter data, etc.</p>
            <p>Sorting is supported by many languages and the interfaces often obscure what's actually happening to the programmer. While this abstraction is welcome and necessary for effective work, it can sometimes be deadly for efficiency, and it's good to know how to implement various algorithms and be familiar with their pros and cons, as well as how to easily access built-in implementations.</p>
