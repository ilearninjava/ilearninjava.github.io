            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">12. What is VCS?</span></h3>
            <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Version control systems are a kind of software tool which reports the changes in the code and integrates these changes with the existing code. As the developer makes changes in the code frequently, these types of tools are helpful in integrating the new code smoothly without disturbing the work of other team members. Along with integration, it will test the new code so that we can avoid the code leading to bugs)</span></p>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">13. What are the types of Version Control Systems?</span></h3>
            <p>Primarily there are three types of Version control systems they are:</p>

            <li>Centralized Version Control Systems</li>
            <li>Distributed Version Control Systems</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">14. What are the benefits of version control?</span></h3>
            <p>The primary benefits you can expect from a version control system are the following:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Complete long-term change history of every file is available.</li>
            <li>All the past versions and variants are kept independent from each other inside the VCS through branching, and whenever required, you can merge back together with the file’s content to verify the changes.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">15. What is a branching strategy in DevOps?</span></h3>
            <p>Branching is a technique employed for code isolation. In simple terms, it makes a copy of the source code to create two versions that are developed separately. There are various types of branching available. Therefore, the DevOps team must make a choice depending on application requirements. This choice is called a branching strategy.</p>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">16. What is Git?</span></h3>
            <p>Git is a distributed version control system particularly used for recording the changes in the source code during software development. It manages a set of files or a project that change over time. It stores the information in a data structure called the repository.</p>
            <p><strong>Let's understand the importance of Git through its benefits to organizations:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Feature branch workflow</li>

            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">31. What’s the difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?</span></h3>
            <p><strong>Continuous Delivery:</strong> It is a process in which continuous integration, automated testing, and automated deployment capabilities develop, build, test, and release high-quality software rapidly and reliably with minimal manual overhead.</p>
            <p><strong>Continuous Deployment:</strong> It is a process in which qualified changes in the architecture or software code are deployed automatically to production as soon as they are ready and without human intervention.</p>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">32. Explain the implementation of Continuous Testing in DevOps?</span></h3>
            <p>By following the below-mentioned steps we can implement continuous testing in DevOps:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>&nbsp;In DevOps continuous testing starts in the development phase, as the developer tests the functionality of the code by using tools like selenium.</li>
            <li>Tools like GitHub store these tests and versions along with the software code. DevOps team uses these tests to perform testing on the new build of the software code.</li>
            <li>when the code reaches pre-production, the professional QA team uses these tests by making some changes to the test specifications.</li>
            <li>the operations team can reuse these tests for user acceptance testing and for resolving the post-delivery issues.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">33. What is the significance of Continuous Testing in DevOps?</span></h3>
            <p>The continuous testing process is done in DevOps to avoid testing the entire code at a time. In traditional SDLC, we will test the code after the whole code is developed but in DevOps, we will test instantly every change made in the code. This kind of testing avoids delays in the product release, and it will also help to achieve better quality in the product.</p>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">34. What is the objective of Configuration Management?</span></h3>
            <ul>
            <li>The objective of Continuous Management is to manage all the configurations of the SDLC by making the development/deployment process controllable and reliable to provide high-quality software.</li>
            <li>There are various components in a configuration management system such as servers, networking, storage, and software. The main purpose of configuration management is to make sure the target systems and software are in the desired state.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">35. Which are the best configuration management tools?</span></h3>
            <p>The best Configuration Management tools are mentioned below:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Chef -</strong> Automation platform that transforms infrastructure into code.</li>
            <li><strong>Ansible -</strong> Automates entire IT infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Puppet -</strong> Open-source configuration management tool.</li>
            <li><strong>Saltstack -</strong> It is based on the Python programming language and allows scalable and efficient configuration.</li>
            <li><strong>CFEngine -</strong> Open-source configuration management tool, which automates large-scale and complex IT infrastructure.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also mention any other tools if you have real-time experience in your previous job and explain how it improves the software development process.</p>
            
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">36. Why is Infrastructure as code important?&nbsp;</span></h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Infrastructure as code (IaC) is a method to manage and provision IT infrastructure (networks, databases, connection topology, etc.) through source code, rather than manual process or interactive configuration tools.</li>
            <li>It helps you to automate the infrastructure deployment process easily, consistently, and reliably.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">37. How does configuration management differ from provisioning infrastructure?</span></h3>
            <p>Configuration management and provisioning infrastructure, both are important for the DevOps toolchain. While configuration management is best when it comes to employing desired configurations for target machines or groups of machines, provisioning helps you to create, modify, delete, and track infrastructure using APIs or code.</p>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">38. What is Puppet?</span></h3>
            <p>Puppet is an open-source configuration management tool used for deploying, configuring, and managing servers. It follows a client-server architecture, in which the client is an agent, and the server is known as the master.</p>
            <p>Puppet agent and master communicate through a secure encrypted channel with the help of SSL.</p>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">39. What is a Puppet Manifest?</span></h3>
            <p>Puppet Manifest is a base component for the Puppet configuration management policy. In Puppet Master, each Puppet node or Puppet Agent has its configuration details written in the native Puppet language. The details that are written in a language that puppets can understand and describe how resources should be configured are termed as Puppet manifests.</p>
            <p>Puppet Manifests declares resources that define a state to be enforced on a node. They are considered to be building blocks for complex Puppet modules.</p>

            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">40. How Puppet Module is different from Puppet Manifests?</span></h3>
            <p>Puppet Module is a bundle of manifests and data. They have a specific directory structure that allows Puppet to automatically load classes, facts, custom types, defined types, and tasks. Modules must have a valid name and are installed in Puppet’s module path.</p>
            <p>Puppet Manifests are nothing but Puppet programs that are composed of Puppet code. It uses.PP extension.</p>
            <h3><a id="codedir"></a><span style="font-size: 18px;">41. Explain Puppet Codedir.</span></h3>
            <p>Puppet Codedir is the main directory for Puppet code and data and is mostly used by Puppet master and Puppetapply. It consists of a global modules directory, Hiera data, and environments (which consists of your manifests and modules).</p>
            <p><strong>The Codedir will be located in one of the following locations:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Unix:</li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="language-markup"><code>/etc/puppetlabs/code
            
            Unix non-root users:
            
             ~/.puppetlabs/etc/code</code></pre>
            <ul>
            <li>Windows:</li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="language-markup"><code> %PROGRAMDATA%PuppetLabscode </code></pre>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">42. How can you configure systems with Puppet?</span></h3>
            <p>You can configure systems with Puppet in two ways:&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
            <li>In client or server architecture, you should use the Puppet Agent and Puppet Master.</li>
            <li>In stand-alone architecture, you should use the Puppet application.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">43. What is Factor in Puppet? How does it work?</span></h3>
            <p>The factor is Puppet’s cross-platform system profiling library. Puppet uses factors to gather information during the Puppet run.</p>
            <p>Factor discovers and reports basic information of Puppet Agent including network settings, IP addresses, hardware details, etc., and makes available in Puppet manifests as variables.</p>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">44. How does Ansible work?</span></h3>
            <p>Ansible is an open-source automation tool. It operates by connecting to your nodes and pushing out small programs called Ansible modules to them. It executes these modules through SSH by default and removes them when finished.</p>
            <p>It handles many nodes from a single system over an SSH connection by using Ansible playbooks. These Playbooks are capable to execute multiple tasks and represented in YAML format.</p>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">45. How Ansible playbook is different from ad-hoc commands?&nbsp;</span></h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Ansible playbook is a structured unit of scripts that describes work for server configuration. It is used for repeated actions.</li>
            <li>An ad-hoc command is used to do something quicker, mostly one-time use.</li>
            </ul>
           
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">46. How to get a list of Ansible predefined variables?</span></h3>
            <p>Ansible stores facts about machines under management by default and these can be accessed in playbooks and templates. To get a list of all the facts that are available about a machine, run a setup module as an ad-hoc action:&nbsp;</p>
            <pre class="language-markup"><code>Ansible -m setup hostname</code></pre>
            <p>This will present all the facts that are available under that particular host.</p>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">47. What are Ansible Handlers?</span></h3>
            <p>Handlers are exactly like regular tasks inside an Ansible playbook but run only when the task contains notify directive and also additional information if it changes something.</p>
            <p><strong>Eg:</strong> When a config file was changed, the task referencing that config file notifies the service restart handler.</p>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">48. How does Chef work?</span></h3>
            <p>Start your answer by defining Chef. It is an automation platform that is particularly used for transforming infrastructure into code. It uses pure-Ruby domain-specific language to write system configurations.</p>
            <p>Now you can explain the architecture of Chef and how it works.</p>
            <p><strong>Chef architecture consists of three core components: </strong></p>
            <p>Chef Workstation, Chef Node, and Chef Servers.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Chef Server:</strong> The chef Server is the core point for infrastructure configuration data. It stores, configures, manages, and presents the configuration data to all components.</li>
            <li><strong>Chef Workstation:</strong> Workstations are the hosts where you can create, test, and modify your cookbooks and configuration data.</li>
            <li><strong>Chef Node:</strong> These are the servers managed by the Chef. Chef client is installed on each node which is under management by Chef. Chef clients run on the nodes to contact the chef server for the information required to configure the node.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">49. Explain Chef Resources.</span></h3>
            <p>First, begin with the definition of a Chef Resource. A Chef Resource describes a piece of an operating system at its desired state. It is a configuration policy statement that is used for representing the desired state of a node to which you want to take the current configuration for using the resource providers.</p>
            <p><strong>The functions of a Chef Resource are listed below:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>It helps to know the present status of the target machine.</li>
            <li>Defines the steps needed to perform for getting the target machine to the desired state.</li>
            <li>Specifies resource types such as template, package, file, or service.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><a id="cookbook"></a><span style="font-size: 18px;">50. How Chef CookBook is different from Chef Recipe?</span></h3>
            <ul>
            <li>A Chef Recipe is a set of resources that primarily configures a software package or some piece of infrastructure. Recipes are written in the Ruby language.</li>
            <li>While a Chef Cookbook consists of recipes that a node desired state.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">51. What happens when you don’t specify a Resource’s action in Chef</span></h3>
            <p>In case, if you don't specify a resource’s action, then Chef applies the default action.</p>
            <p>For example, in resource 1, the action is not specified, still, it will take a default action.</p>
            <pre class="language-markup"><code>file 'C:UsersAdministratorchef-reposettings.ini' do
            
            content 'greeting=hello world'
            
            end</code></pre>
            <p>In resource 2, when you define the action with create command, it is also used to create the default action.</p>
            <pre class="language-markup"><code>file 'C:UsersAdministratorchef-reposettings.ini' do
            
            action :create
            
            content 'greeting=hello world'
            
            end</code></pre>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">52. How to refresh static components of a deployed application without redeploying the entire application?</span></h3>
            <p>By using Weblogic.Deployer you can define a component and target a server through the following syntax:</p>
            <pre class="language-markup"><code>java weblogic.Deployer -adminurl http://admin:7001 -name appname -targets server1,server2 -deploy jsps/*.jsp</code></pre>
            <h3><a id="auto-deployment"></a><span style="font-size: 18px;">53. How to turn off the auto-deployment feature?</span></h3>
            <p>The auto-deployment feature is used for determining whether there are any new applications or changes in existing applications and dynamically deploy them.</p>
            <p>It is enabled for servers that run in development mode.</p>
            <p>To turn off the auto-deployment feature, follow one of the methods to place servers in production mode:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>In the Administration Console, click the name of the domain in the left pane and select the Production Mode checkbox in the right pane.</li>
            <li>At the command line, include the following argument when starting the domain’s Administration Server:</li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="language-markup"><code>-Dweblogic.ProductionModeEnabled=true</code></pre>
            <ul>
            <li>Production mode is set for all WebLogic Server instances in a given domain.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">54. Why is Continuous Monitoring important?</span></h3>
            <p>Continuous Monitoring helps to detect and measure the security implications for planned and unexpected changes and assesses the vulnerabilities in a threat space.</p>
            <p>It delivers information on the application’s performance and usage patterns.</p>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">55. Which are the best Continuous Monitoring tools?</span></h3>
            <p>The following are the best Continuous Monitoring tools:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Nagios</li>
            <li>Tenable</li>
            <li>Solarwinds</li>

            <li>Spiceworks</li>
            <li>Snort</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3><span style="font-size: 18px;">56. &nbsp;what is containerization in DevOps and list their benefits?</span></h3>
            <p>Containerization is defined as a process of binding the application and its required environment. Binding makes the application run in any computational environment. DevOps main goal is to bridge the gap between the development team and the operations team. To bridge the gap between them, it should make both sides work on an identical environment. Containerization helps in setting an identical environment quickly, and it will provide easy access to operating system resources. Docker tool is widely used for implementing containerization in DevOps.</p>
            <p>They are a streamlined way to create, test, deploy, and redeploy applications in multiple environments.</p>
            <p><strong>Benefits of Containers are listed below:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Less overhead</li>
            <li>Improved productivity</li>
            <li>More consistent operation</li>
            <li>Better application deployment</li>
            <li>Greater efficiency</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><a id="docker-container"></a><span style="font-size: 18px;">57. What is a Docker Container and how do you create it?</span></h3>
            <ul>
            <li>A Docker container is an open-source software development platform that stores the code and all of its dependencies and runs the application quickly and reliably from one computing environment to the other.</li>
            <li>Docker containers are not specified to any particular infrastructure; they can run on any infrastructure, on any computer, and in any cloud.</li>
            <li>A Docker container image is a standalone, lightweight, and executable package of software that has everything to run the application such as code, system tools, runtime, system libraries, and settings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Docker Containers can be created with the Docker image using the following command:</strong></p>
            <pre class="language-markup"><code>docker run -t -i &lt;image name&gt; &lt;command name&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>This will create and start the container.</p>
            <p>If you want to check the list of all running containers with status on the host, use the following command:</p>
            <pre class="language-markup"><code>docker ps -a</code></pre>
