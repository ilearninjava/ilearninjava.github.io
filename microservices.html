</div></div><p>Microservices architecture is a method of developing a large-scale application in the form of discrete modules that work independently of each other but as a whole account for the entire business application under consideration. Organizations are increasingly adopting this service for developing enterprise solutions. As this operates on simple, modular services, there is now an increasing demand for cloud solutions.<span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-124" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad"></span></p>
<p>Microservices deployment can be Cloud-Based or On-Premise. It's market spans across Healthcare, Banking, Government, Manufacturing, Retail, IT &amp; Telecommunication, Media &amp; Entertainment, Manufacturing, etc. Its intended audience includes Investors and Consultants, System Integrators, Government Organizations, IT &amp; Technology Solution Providers. To name a few, prominent players in this field of expertise are Cognizant, IBM, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Software AG. The microservices architecture market is expected to take a massive leap by the year 2023.</p>

<h4 id="question-what-do-you-understand-by-microservices">
  <strong>Question: What do you understand by Microservices?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Microservices or more appropriately Microservices Architecture is an SDLC approach based on which large applications are built as a collection of small functional modules. These functional modules are independently deployable, scalable, target specific business goals, and communicate with each other over standard protocols. Such modules can also be implemented using different programming languages, have their databases, and deployed on different software environments. Each module here is minimal and complete.</p>

<h4 id="question-what-are-the-main-features-of-microservices"><strong>Question: What are the main features of Microservices?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Microservices have the following main features:<span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-125" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple Individually Deployable Components.</li>
<li>Service Distribution based on Business Capabilities.</li>
<li>Decentralized Data Management.</li>
<li>DevOps Implementation.</li>
<li>Technical Independence.</li>
<li>Hidden Component Complexity to avoid unnecessary microservices dependencies.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="question-what-are-the-main-components-of-microservices"><strong>Question: What are the main components of Microservices?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The main components for a Microservice Architecture are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Containers, Clustering, and Orchestration</li>
<li>IaC [Infrastructure as Code Conception]</li>
<li>Cloud Infrastructure</li>
<li>API Gateway</li>
<li>Enterprise Service Bus</li>
<li>Service Delivery</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="question-how-does-a-microservice-architecture-work"><strong>Question: How does a Microservice Architecture work?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Under a microservice architecture, an application is simplified into multiple modules that independently perform the single precise standalone task:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are fragmented into loosely coupled various modules, each of which performs a distinct function.</li>
<li>It can be or are distributed across clouds and data centers.</li>
<li>Implement each module as an independent service/process which can be replaced, updated, or deleted without disrupting the rest of the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under microservice architecture, an application can grow along with its requirements.<span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-126" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad"></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 box-4 box-4126 adtester-container adtester-container-126" data-ez-name="hackr_io-box-4" style="min-height: 400px;"><span id="div-gpt-ad-hackr_io-box-4-0" ezaw="580" ezah="400" style="position: relative; z-index: 0; padding: 0px; width: 100%; max-width: 1200px; min-height: 400px; min-width: 580px; margin-left: auto !important; margin-right: auto !important;" class="ezoic-ad" data-google-query-id="CPCavv2Ox_sCFbqGZgIdFs8J3w"><div id="google_ads_iframe_/1254144,22535388737/hackr_io-box-4_0__container__" style="border: 0pt none;"><iframe id="google_ads_iframe_/1254144,22535388737/hackr_io-box-4_0" name="google_ads_iframe_/1254144,22535388737/hackr_io-box-4_0" title="3rd party ad content" width="580" height="400" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" role="region" aria-label="Advertisement" tabindex="0" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;" data-load-complete="true" data-google-container-id="7"></iframe></div></span></span></p><div class="text-center">

<h4 id="question-what-is-domain-driven-design"><strong>Question: What is Domain Driven Design?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Domain-Driven Design is an architectural style based on Object-Oriented Analysis Design concepts and principles. It helps in developing a complex system by connecting the related components of the software system into a continuously evolving system. Domain-Driven Design is based on three core principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on the core domain and domain logic.</li>
<li>Base complex designs on models of the domain.</li>
<li>Regularly collaborate with the domain experts to improve the application model and resolve any emerging domain-related issues.</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="question-what-is-the-difference-between-monolithic-soa-and-microservices-architecture"><strong>Question: What is the difference between Monolithic, SOA and Microservices Architecture?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monolithic Architecture: </strong>In this type of architecture, different components of an application like UI, business logic, data access layer are combined into a single platform or program.</li>
<li><strong>SOA (Service Oriented Architecture):</strong> In this architecture, individual components are loosely coupled and perform a discrete function. There are two main roles – service provider and service consumer. In SOA type, modules can be integrated and reused, making it flexible and reliable.</li>
<li><strong>Microservices Architecture: </strong>It is a type of SOA in which a series of autonomous components are built and combined to make an app. These components are integrated using APIs. This approach focuses on business priorities and capabilities and offers high agility, i.e. each component of the app can be built independently of the other.</li><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span style="clear:both; display:block" id="ez-clearholder-banner-1"></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 banner-1 banner-1360 adtester-container adtester-container-360" data-ez-name="hackr_io-banner-1" style="min-height: 400px;"><span id="div-gpt-ad-hackr_io-banner-1-0" ezaw="336" ezah="280" style="position: relative; z-index: 0; padding: 0px; width: 100%; max-width: 1200px; min-height: 400px; min-width: 580px; margin-left: auto !important; margin-right: auto !important;" class="ezoic-ad" data-google-query-id="CIat_P6Ox_sCFZyNZgIdypoEfw"><div id="google_ads_iframe_/1254144,22535388737/hackr_io-banner-1_0__container__" style="border: 0pt none;"><iframe id="google_ads_iframe_/1254144,22535388737/hackr_io-banner-1_0" name="google_ads_iframe_/1254144,22535388737/hackr_io-banner-1_0" title="3rd party ad content" width="580" height="400" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" role="region" aria-label="Advertisement" tabindex="0" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;" data-load-complete="true" data-google-container-id="b"></iframe></div></span></span>

<h4 id="question-difference-between-cohesion-and-coupling"><strong>Question: Difference between Cohesion and Coupling?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer: Coupling: </strong>it is the relationship between module A and another module B. Any module can be highly coupled (highly dependent), loosely coupled and uncoupled with other modules. The best coupling is loose coupling achieved through interfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Cohesion:</strong> it is the relationship between 2 or more parts within a module. If a module has high cohesion, it means the module can perform a certain task with utmost efficiency on its own, without communication with other modules. High cohesion enhances the functional strength of a module.<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://hackr.io/blog/media/cohesion-and-coupling.png" alt="Cohesion and Coupling" width="426" height="130"></p>

<h4 id="question-what-is-distributed-transaction"><strong>Question: What is Distributed Transaction?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Distribution transaction has two or more network hosts that are engaged. Transactions are handled by a transaction manager that takes care of developing and handling transactions. If the transaction involves more than one peer, transaction managers of each peer communicate with each other using subordinate or superior relationships.</p>
<p>Same way, resources are handled by the resource manager that also coordinates with the distributed transaction coordinator for transaction atomicity and isolation.</p>
<h4 id="question-explain-end-to-end-microservices-testing"><strong>Question: Explain end to end Microservices Testing?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>It is a testing technique used to test the entire flow of an application using a business transaction. Since several components are involved in microservices architecture, these tests can cover the gaps during a unit or integration testing. It also gives end to end confidence, ensures that the network parameters are appropriately configured and helps microservices to evolve.</p><div class="text-center" style="display: flex;justify-content: space-between;">

<h4 id="question-what-is-a-container"><strong>Question: What is a Container?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Containers are isolated workload environments in a virtualized operating system. It consists of an application and all the features and files required to run it. Each box is an independent environment and is not tied to the software on a physical environment, thus providing a solution for application portability.</p>


</div>


<h4 id="question-what-are-coupling-and-cohesion"><strong>Question: What are Coupling and Cohesion?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The strength of dependencies between services in a microservice architecture is said to be coupling. Cohesion refers to the related logic between two or more services. The entire concept of microservices is based on the ability to deploy and update service while keeping other services intact. Hence, loose coupling and high cohesion is the key to a microservice design.<span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-129" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad"></span></p>
<h4 id="question-what-is-pact-in-microservices-architecture"><strong>Question: What is PACT in Microservices Architecture?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A contract between a consumer application and a provider application is called a PACT. Each pact is a collection of interactions. It is an open-source tool that can be used to implement the Consumer-Driven Contract in Microservices.</p>
<h4 id="question-what-is-contract-testing"><strong>Question: What is Contract Testing?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Contract Testing ensures that the explicit and implicit contracts of a microservice architecture work as expected. There are two perspectives to contract to test – Consumer and Provider. The consumer is the [application] entity using the microservice, and the provider is the [application] entity providing the service. Such services work under predefined specifications, and contract testing ensures so.</p>
<h4 id="question-what-is-oauth"><strong>Question: What is OAuth?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> OAuth stands for Open-standard Authorization Protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without sharing the initial related, single login credential. This is also known as secure, third-party, user-agent, delegated authorization.</p>
<h4 id="question-what-can-you-derive-understand-from-conway-s-law"><strong>Question: What can you derive/understand from Conway’s Law?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Melvin Conway stated this idea in the late 1960s. This law implies that ‘organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.” In simpler words, the team of people who design a piece of software will eventually make the design as per their perspective.</p>

<h4 id="question-what-are-the-steps-in-an-end-to-end-microservices-testing"><strong>Question: What are the steps in an End-to-End Microservices Testing?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> End-To-End testing of a microservice application ensures that every process in the form is running properly. This validates that the system as a whole is working properly. As the microservices application is built with multiple modules orchestrated dynamically, an end to end testing covers all the gaps between the services.</p>
<p>The steps to an end-to-end microservices testing are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define what you expect from an e2e testing.</li>
<li>Define the scope of the system to be tested.</li>
<li>Perform authentication in a test environment.</li>
<li>Choose a testing framework that addresses most of the issues.</li>
<li>Test Asynchronous flows</li>
<li>Automate Testing</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="question-what-is-the-difference-between-mock-stub"><strong>Question: What is the difference between Mock &amp; Stub?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A Mock is generally a dummy object where certain features are set into it initially. Its behavior mainly depends on these features, which are then tested.</p>
<p>A Stub is an object that helps in running the test. It functions in a fixed manner under certain conditions. This hard-coded behavior helps the stub to run the test.</p><div class="text-center" style="display: flex;justify-content: space-between;">

<li>Define tests with different granularity</li>
<li>The higher in the level you get, the fewer tests you should have.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="question-how-does-docker-help-in-microservices"><strong>Question: How does Docker help in Microservices?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Microservices, as we know, are self-contained, individual units that perform only one business function, so much so that each unit can be considered an application on its own. The application development environment and application deployment environment are bound to vary in many aspects. This gives rise to deployment issues. Docker provides a static background for the application to run, thus avoiding deployment issues. It is, in fact, a containerization tool. It reduces overhead and deploys thousands of microservices on the same server. Docker ensures that an application microservices will run on their own environments and are entirely separate from their operating system.</p>
<h4 id="question-what-is-canary-releasing"><strong>Question: What is Canary Releasing?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Canary releasing is a technique by which new software versions are introduced by rolling out the updated version to a small subset of users before rolling it out to the entire infrastructure and making it available to everybody. This technique is so-called because it is based on canary releases in coal mines to alert miners when the toxic gases reach dangerous levels.</p>

<h4 id="question-what-are-the-different-types-of-credentials-of-a-two-factor-authentication"><strong>Question: What are the different types of credentials of a two-factor Authentication?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Two-factor authentication calls for a second round of authentication to an account login process. Entering a username – password is a one-factor authentication. Username – Password authentication and then say mobile number or a secret key authentication can be considered as a two - factor authentication.</p>
<p>The different types of credentials for two-factor authentication can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Something you know - A PIN, password or a pattern</li>
<li>Something you have – ID, ATM No., Phone No, or an OTP</li>
<li>Something you are – Your Biometrics.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="question-what-is-a-client-certificate"><strong>Question: What is a Client Certificate?</strong></h4>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong>If an exception occurs while processing an HTTP request, you need to catch the exception in your controller or service and return an appropriate ResponseEntity manually. Here are some thumb rules for exception handling.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add @ResponseStatus for exceptions that you write.</li>
<li>For all other exceptions, implement an @ExceptionHandler method on a @ControllerAdvice class or use an instance of SimpleMappingExceptionResolver.</li>
<li>For Controller specific exceptions, add @ExceptionHandler methods to your controller.</li>
</ul>
<p>Point to be noted is that @ExceptionHandler methods on the controller are always selected before those on any @ControllerAdvice instance. It is undefined in what order ControllerAdvices are processed.</p>
<p><strong>Question: How can you access RESTful Microservices?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Considering the microservice architecture concept, each microservice needs to have an interface. Based on the principles of open networking of the Web, RESTful APIs provide the most logical model for building interfaces between the various components of the microservices architecture. RESTful APIs can be accessed in two ways:</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_12"></span><span style="clear:both; display:block" id="ez-clearholder-narrow-sky-2"></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 narrow-sky-2 narrow-sky-2707 adtester-container adtester-container-707" data-ez-name="hackr_io-narrow-sky-2" style="width: 100%; height: auto; min-height: 250px;"><span id="div-gpt-ad-hackr_io-narrow-sky-2-0" ezaw="300" ezah="250" style="position: relative; z-index: 0; padding: 0px; min-height: 250px; min-width: 300px; width: 100%; height: auto;" class="ezoic-ad" data-google-query-id="CKrWlJOPx_sCFXGgZgIdLdYLDQ"><div id="google_ads_iframe_/1254144,22535388737/hackr_io-narrow-sky-2_0__container__" style="border: 0pt none;"><iframe id="google_ads_iframe_/1254144,22535388737/hackr_io-narrow-sky-2_0" name="google_ads_iframe_/1254144,22535388737/hackr_io-narrow-sky-2_0" title="3rd party ad content" width="1" height="1" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" role="region" aria-label="Advertisement" tabindex="0" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;" data-load-complete="true" data-google-container-id="l"></iframe></div></span></span>

<li>Using a REST Template that is load balanced.</li>
<li>I am using multiple microservices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question: How do independent Microservices communicate with each other?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Microservices can communicate with each other through:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP for traditional Request-Response.</li>
<li>Websockets for streaming.</li>
<li>Brokers or Server Programs running Advanced Routing Algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<p>For message brokers, <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RabbitMQ</a>, Nats, Kafka, etc., can be used, each built for a particular message semantic. Another way is to use Backend As A Service like Space Cloud, which automates the entire backend.</p>
<p><strong>Question: What is Semantic Monitoring?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Semantic Monitoring or Synthetic Monitoring is running a subset of the application’s automated tests against the live production system. These results are monitored, and alerts are generated in case of failures. Semantic Monitoring approaches microservice monitoring from the business transaction perspective. Instead of monitoring each component, its semantic monitoring ascertains how well the transaction performs for business and the users. It also detects the faulty service layer and the corresponding microservice instance, all at the same flow. This approach allows for faster triaging and reduces the meantime to repair.</p>
<p><strong>Question: How do you perform security testing of Microservices?</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_13"></span><span style="clear:both; display:block" id="ez-clearholder-narrow-sky-1"></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 narrow-sky-1 narrow-sky-1708 adtester-container adtester-container-708" data-ez-name="hackr_io-narrow-sky-1" style="min-height: 400px;"><span id="div-gpt-ad-hackr_io-narrow-sky-1-0" ezaw="336" ezah="280" style="position: relative; z-index: 0; padding: 0px; width: 100%; max-width: 1200px; min-height: 400px; min-width: 580px; margin-left: auto !important; margin-right: auto !important;" class="ezoic-ad"><div id="google_ads_iframe_/1254144,22535388737/hackr_io-narrow-sky-1_0__container__" style="border: 0pt none;"></div></span></span>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Microservices Application is a collection of smaller, independent, functional modules that may be developed in different programming languages, have different data sources, and run on different operating systems. This makes testing of the microservices as a whole a very tough task. The different pieces/modules need to be tested independently. There are three common procedures for this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Code Scanning: In order to ensure that every line of code is bug-free and can be replicated.</li>
<li>Flexibility: The security protocols should be flexible as per the requirements of the system.</li>
<li>Adaptability: The security protocols should be adaptable to the malicious intrusions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question: What do you understand by Idempotence, and how is it used?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Idempotence refers to the repeated performing of a task even though the end result remains the same. It is used mostly as a data source or a remote service in a way that when it receives the instruction more than once, it processes the instruction only once.</p>
<p><strong>Question: What are the uses of Reports and Dashboards in Microservices environments?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Reports and Dashboards are generally used to monitor a system. For microservices Reports and Dashboards help to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find which microservice support which resource.</li>
<li>Find out the services that are impacted whenever changes in components are made/occur.</li>
<li>Provide an easy point of access for documentation purposes.</li>
<li>Review versions of the deployed components.</li>
<li>Obtain compliance from the components.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question: What are the tools that can be considered for managing a microservice architecture?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>The main tools that can be used to build/manage a microservice architecture are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>MongoDB:</strong> It is a document-based open-source distributed database. Here data is stored in JSON format with a different structure for different documents. It also supports a lot of programming languages like C, C++, C#, PERL, PHP, Python, Java, Ruby, Scala, etc.</li><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_14"></span><span style="clear:both; display:block" id="ez-clearholder-netboard-1"></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 netboard-1 netboard-1709 adtester-container adtester-container-709" data-ez-name="hackr_io-netboard-1" style="min-height: 400px;"><span id="div-gpt-ad-hackr_io-netboard-1-0" ezaw="250" ezah="250" style="position: relative; z-index: 0; padding: 0px; width: 100%; max-width: 1200px; min-height: 400px; min-width: 580px; margin-left: auto !important; margin-right: auto !important;" class="ezoic-ad"><div id="google_ads_iframe_/1254144,22535388737/hackr_io-netboard-1_0__container__" style="border: 0pt none;"></div></span></span>
<li><strong>Elasticsearch:</strong> It is a full-text search engine.</li>
<li><strong>KAFKA:</strong> It is an event queue system. All transactions are processed via the event queue, thus avoiding the web like random interactions between different services. Kafka renders a microservice architecture robust and clean.</li>
<li><strong>JENKINS:</strong> It is an automation tool that enables Continuous Integration and Continuous Development. It supports many plugins and easily integrates with almost every tool.</li>
<li><strong>DOCKER:</strong> The application development environment and application deployment environment are bound to vary in many aspects. This gives rise to deployment issues. Docker provides a static background for the application to run, thus avoiding deployment issues.</li>
<li><strong>KUBERNETES:</strong> With thousands of services running in an application, Kubernetes, as an engine orchestrates the entire process.</li>
<li><strong>JAEGER:</strong> It is an open-source end to end distributed tracing tool. Jaeger monitors distributed transactions, helps in performance optimization, and finds the dependencies between services. It also gives the root cause analysis.</li>
<li><strong>FLUENT:</strong> In a multiservice architecture, where all the different systems are managed via different programming languages, different databases, and run in different operating systems, logging in, and keeping track of it is a significant issue. Fluentd provides a single logging layer and simplifies this issue. Logs can be also be collected and aggregated onto a data source.</li>
<li><strong>PROMETHEUS:</strong> It is a monitoring tool, which helps to check if all services are working fine when the application is deployed. It is a time-series data store. It collects metrics from an application and displays it in a graphical format.</li>
<li><strong>grafana:</strong> Grafana provides analytics and monitoring into different visualization formats like graphs, charts, tables, etc.</li>
<li><strong>NGINX:</strong> It acts as a reverse proxy. It acts as a single point entry through which all the API calls are made.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="question-how-do-you-create-state-machines-out-of-microservices"><strong>Question: How do you create State Machines out of Microservices?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Each microservice owning its database is an independently deployable program. This enables the creation of State Machines by which we can specify different states and events for a particular microservice.</p>
<h4 id="question-what-are-the-most-common-mistakes-while-transitioning-to-microservices"><strong>Question: What are the most common mistakes while transitioning to Microservices?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Failure to outline the main challenges.</li>
<li>I am rewriting already existing programs.</li>

<li>Vague definitions of responsibilities, timeline, and boundaries.</li>
<li>Failure to identify and implement automation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="question-where-is-the-webmvc-test-annotation-used"><strong>Question: Where is the WebMVC Test Annotation used?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> WebMvcTest Annotation is used for unit testing Spring MVC Applications, where the test objective is to focus on Spring MVC Components.</p>
<p>Ex: @WebMvcTest(value = ToTestController.class, secure = false)</p>
<p>In the above example, the intention is to launch the ToTestController. All other controllers and mappings will not be launched when this unit test is executed.</p>
<h4 id="question-give-one-a-few-examples-of-microservices-implementation"><strong>Question: Give one/a few examples of microservices implementation.</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Netflix, Paypal, Amazon, eBay, Twitter, and many other large-scale websites have started as monolithic and evolved into a microservices architecture.</p>
