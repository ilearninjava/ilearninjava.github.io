            <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Q #3) What are the advantages of Jenkins? Why we use Jenkins?</strong></span></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Jenkins is used to continuously monitor the large code base in real-time. It enables developers to find bugs in their code and fix them. Email notifications are made to the developers regarding their check-ins as a post-build action.</p>
            <p><strong>Advantages of Jenkins are as follows:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Build failures are cached during the integration stage.</li>
            <li>Notifies the developers about build report status using LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) mail server.</li>
            <li>Maven release project is automated with simple steps.</li>
            <li>Easy bug tracking.</li>
            <li>Automatic changes get updated in the build report with notification.</li>
            <li>Supports Continuous Integration in agile development and test-driven development.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Q #4) Mention some of the important plugins in Jenkins?</strong></span></p>
            <p><strong>Answer: </strong><strong>Plugins in Jenkins includes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Gits</li>

            <li>Amazon EC2</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Q #5) What is Continuous Integration in Jenkins?</strong></span></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Continuous integration is the process of continuously checking-in the developer’s code into a version control system and triggering the build to check and identify bugs in the written code.</p>
            <p><strong>This is a very quick process and also gives them a chance to fix the bugs. Jenkins is one such continuous integration tool.&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>In software development, multiple developers work on different software modules.&nbsp;While performing integration testing all the modules are being integrated together. It is considered as the development practice to integrate the code into the source repository</p>
            <p>Whenever the programmer/developer makes any change to the current code, then it automatically<br>
            gets integrated with the system running on the tester’s machine and makes the testing task easy and speedy for the system testers.</p>
            <p><strong>Continuous Integration comprises of:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Development and Compilation</li>
            <li>Database Integration</li>
            <li>Unit Testing</li>
            <li>Production Deployment</li>
            <li>Code Labeling</li>
            <li>Functional Testing</li>
            <li>Generating and Analyzing Reports</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Q #6) What is the difference between Hudson and Jenkins?</strong></span></p>
            <p><strong>Answer: </strong>There is no difference between Hudson and Jenkins. Hudson was the former name of Jenkins, after going through several issues the name was changed to Jenkins.</p>
            <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Q #7) What is Groovy in Jenkins?</span></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Groovy is the default scripting language that is being used in the development of JMeter Version 3.1.</p>
            <p>Currently Apache Groovy is the dynamic object-oriented programming language that is used as a scripting language for the Java platform. Apache Groovy comes with some useful features such as Java Compatibility and Development Support.</p>
            <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Q #8)</span> <span style="color: #ff6600;">Which command is used to start Jenkins?</span></strong></p>

            <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Q #9) What is Jenkinsfile? </span></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer: </strong>The text file where all the definitions of pipelines are defined is called Jenkinsfile. It is being checked in the source control repository.</p>
            <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Q #10)&nbsp;What is the difference between Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment?</span></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer: </strong>The diagrammatic representation given below can elaborate on the differences between Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment more precisely.</p>
            <p><strong> Continuous Integration:</strong></p>
            <p><img src="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2019/02/Continuous-Integration.png"></p>
            <p>(It involves keeping the latest copy of the source code at a commonly shared hub where all the developers can check to fetch out the latest change in order to avoid conflict.)</p>
            <p><strong> Continuous Delivery:</strong></p>
            <p><img src="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2019/02/Continuous-Delivery.png"></p>
            <p>(<strong>Manual Deployment to Production. </strong>It does not involve every change to be deployed.)</p>
            <p><strong> Continuous Deployment:</strong></p>
            <p><img src="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2019/02/Continuous-Deployment.png"></p>
            <p>(<strong>Automated Deployment to Production. </strong>Involves every change to be deployed automatically.)</p>
            <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Q #11) What is Jenkins Pipeline? What is a CI CD pipeline?</strong></span></p>
            <p><strong>Answer: </strong>The pipeline can be defined as the suite of plugins supporting the implementation and integration of continuous delivery pipelines in Jenkins.</p>
            <p>Continuous integration or continuous delivery pipeline consists of build, deploy, test, release pipeline. The pipeline feature saves a lot of time and error in maintaining the builds. Basically, a pipeline is a group of build jobs that are chained and integrated in sequence.</p>
            <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Q #12) What are Scripted Pipelines in Jenkins?</span></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer: Scripted Pipeline follows Groovy Syntax as given below:</strong></p>
            <pre>Node {
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}</pre>
            <p>In the above syntax, the<strong> node</strong> is a part of the Jenkins distributed mode architecture, where there are two types of node, <strong>Master</strong> which handle all the tasks in the development environment and the<strong> Agent </strong>is being used to handle multiple tasks individually.</p>
            <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Q #13) What are Declarative Pipelines in Jenkins?</span></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Declarative Pipelines are the newest additions to Jenkins that simplify the groovy syntax of Jenkins pipelines (top-level pipeline) with some exceptions, such as:</p>
            <p>No semicolon to be used as a statement separator. The top-level pipeline should be enclosed within block viz;</p>
            <p><strong>The common syntax is:</strong></p>
            <pre>pipeline {
            /* Declarative Pipeline */
            }</pre>
            <p>Blocks must contain Sections, Directives, steps or assignments.</p>
            <pre>pipeline {
                            agent any
                            stages {
            stage(‘Build’) {
                            steps {
            // Statements…
                            }
                            }
                   stage (‘Test’) {
                   steps {
                          // Statements…
                   }
                   }
                }
            }</pre>
            <p><strong>The above code has 3 major elements</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Pipeline: </strong>The block of script contents.</li>
            <li><strong>Agent:</strong> Defines where the pipeline will start running from.</li>
            <li><strong>Stage:</strong> The pipelines contain several steps enclosed in the block called Stage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Q #14) What is SCM? Which SCM tools are supported in Jenkins?</span></strong></p>

            <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Q #25) What are the two components (pre-requisites) that Jenkins is mainly integrated with?</strong></span></p>
            <p><strong>Answer: Jenkins integrates with:</strong></p>
            <ol>
            <li>Build tools/ Build working script like Maven script.</li>
            <li>Version control system/Accessible source code repository like Git repository.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Q #26)</span> <span style="color: #ff6600;">How can You Clone a Git Repository via Jenkins?</span></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> To create a clone repository via Jenkins you need to use your login credentials in the Jenkins System.</p>
            <p>To achieve the same you need to enter the Jenkins job directory and execute the <strong>git config</strong> command.</p>
            <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Q #27) How can you secure Jenkins?</span></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer: Securing Jenkins is a little lengthy process, and there are two aspects of securing Jenkins:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>(i) Access Control</strong> which includes authenticating users and giving them an appropriate set of permissions, which can be done in 2 ways.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Security Realm </strong>determines a user or a group of users with their passwords.</li>
            <li><strong>Authorization Strategy</strong> defines what should be accessible to which user. In this case, there might be different types of security based on the permissions granted to the user such as Quick and simple security with easy setup, Standard security setup, Apache front-end security, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>(ii) Protecting Jenkins users from outside threats.</strong></p>
            <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Q #28) How to create a backup and copy files in Jenkins? </span></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> In Jenkins, all the settings, build logs and configurations are stored in the JENKINS_HOME directory. Whenever you want to create a backup of your Jenkins you can back up&nbsp;<strong>JENKINS_HOME</strong> directory frequently.</p>
            <p>It consists of all the job configurations and slave node configurations. Hence, regularly copying this directory allows us to keep a backup of Jenkins.</p>
            <p>You can maintain a separate backfile and copy it whenever you need the same. If you want to copy the Jenkins job, then you can do so by simply replicating the job directory.</p>
            <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Q #29) What is the use of Backup Plugin in Jenkins? How to use it?</span></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Jenkins Backup Plugin is used to back up the critical configurations and settings in order to use them in the future in case of any failure or as per the need of time.</p>
            <p><strong>The following steps are followed to back up your settings by using the Backup Plugin.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Go to the Jenkins Dashboard and click on <strong>Manage Jenkins.</strong></p>

            <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Q #33) How can you define a Continuous Delivery Workflow?</span></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The flowchart below shows the Continuous Delivery Workflow. Hope it will be much easier to understand with visuals.</p>
            <p><img src="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2019/02/Continuous-Delivery-Workflow.png"></p>
            <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Q #34) What are the various ways in which the build can be scheduled in Jenkins?</span></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer: The build can be triggered in the following ways:</strong></p>
            <ol>
            <li>After the completion of other builds.</li>
            <li>By source code management (modifications) commit.</li>
            <li>At a specific time.</li>
            <li>By requesting manual builds.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Q #35) Why is Jenkins called a Continuous Delivery Tool?</span></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> We have seen the Continuous Delivery workflow in the previous question, now let’s see the step by step process of why Jenkins is being called as a Continuous Delivery Tool:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Developers work on their local environment for making changes in the source code and push it into the code repository.</li>
            <li>When a change is detected, Jenkins performs several tests and code standards to check whether the changes are good to deploy or not.</li>
            <li>Upon a successful build, it is being viewed by the developers.</li>
            <li>Then the change is deployed <strong>manually</strong> on a staging environment where the client can have a look at it.</li>
            <li>When all the changes get approved by the developers, testers, and clients, the final outcome is saved <strong>manually </strong>on the production server to be used by the end-users of the product.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In this way, Jenkins follows a <strong>Continuous Delivery approach</strong> and is called the <strong>Continuous Delivery Tool.</strong></p>
            <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Q #36)&nbsp;Give any simple example of Jenkins script.</span></strong></p>
            <p><strong> Answer: This is a Jenkins declarative pipeline code for Java:<br>
            </strong></p>
            <pre>pipeline {
                agent
                stages {
                      stage('Building your first asset') {
                           agent
                           steps {
                               echo 'Build asset'
                }
                }
                    stage('Test') {
                         agent
                         steps {
                               echo 'Building project 1'
                         }
                        }
                     }
            }</pre>
