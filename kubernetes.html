<h3>1) What is Kubernetes?</h3>
<p>Kubernetes is a container management system developed in the Google platform. The purpose of <a href="/kubernetes-tutorial.html" data-lasso-id="286084">Kubernetes</a> is to manage a containerized application in various types of physical, virtual, and cloud environments. Google Kubernetes is a highly flexible container tool to deliver even complex applications, consistently. Applications run on clusters of hundreds to thousands of individual servers.</p>
<hr style="border-top: 1px dashed #8c8b8b;">
<h3>2) Define node in Kubernetes</h3>
<p>A node the smallest unit of hardware. It defines a single machine in a cluster that can be a virtual machine from a cloud provider or physical machine in the data center. Every machine available in the Kubernetes cluster can substitute other machines.</p>

<hr style="border-top: 1px dashed #8c8b8b;">
<h3>3) What is the work of a kube-scheduler?</h3>
<p>Kube-scheduler is the default scheduler for Kubernetes. It assigns nodes to newly created pods.</p>
<hr style="border-top: 1px dashed #8c8b8b;">
<h3>4) Define daemon sets</h3>
<p>Daemon sets are a set of pods that runs on a host. They are used for host layers attributes like monitoring network or simple network.<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<hr style="border-top: 1px dashed #8c8b8b;">

<h3>6) What tasks are performed by Kubernetes?</h3>
<p>Kubernetes is the Linux kernel which is used for distributed systems. It helps you to be abstract the underlying hardware of the nodes(servers) and offers a consistent interface for applications that consume the shared pool of resources.</p>
<hr style="border-top: 1px dashed #8c8b8b;">
<h3>7) Define Kubernetes controller manager</h3>
<p>The controller manager is a daemon used for garbage collection, core control loops, and namespace creation. It enables the running of more than one process on the master node.<br>

<p></p>
<hr style="border-top: 1px dashed #8c8b8b;">
<h3>8) Why use namespace in Kubernetes?</h3>
<p>Namespaces in Kubernetes are used for dividing cluster resources between users. It helps the environment where more than one user spread projects or teams and provides a scope of resources.</p>
<hr style="border-top: 1px dashed #8c8b8b;">
<h3>9) Why use Kubernetes?</h3>
<p>Kubernetes is used because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kubernetes can run on-premises bare metal, OpenStack, public clouds Google, Azure, AWS, etc.</li>
<li>It helps you to avoid vendor lock issues as it can use any vendor-specific APIs or services except where Kubernetes provides an abstraction, e.g., load balancer and storage.</li>
<li>It will enable applications that need to be released and updated without any downtime.</li>
<li>Kubernetes allows you to assure those containerized apps run where and when you want and help you to find resources and tools which you want to work.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="border-top: 1px dashed #8c8b8b;">

<ul>
<li><strong>Master Node: </strong>The master node is the first and most vital component which is responsible for the management of Kubernetes cluster. It is the entry point for all kinds of administrative tasks. There may be more than one master node in the cluster to check for fault tolerance.</li>
<li><strong>API Server:</strong> The API server acts as an entry point for all the REST commands used for controlling the cluster.</li>
<li><strong>Scheduler:</strong> The scheduler schedules the tasks to the slave node. It stores the resource usage information for every slave node. It is responsible for distributing the workload.</li>
<li><strong>Etcd: </strong>etcd components, store configuration detail, and wright values. It communicates with the most component to receive commands and work. It also manages network rules and port forwarding activity.</li>
<li><strong>Worker/Slave nodes: </strong>Worker nodes are another essential component that contains all the required services to manage the networking between the containers, communicate with the master node, which allows you to assign resources to the scheduled containers.</li>
<li><strong>Kubelet:</strong> It gets the configuration of a Pod from the API server and ensures that the described containers are up and running.</li>
<li><strong>Docker Container:</strong> Docker container runs on each of the worker nodes, which runs the configured pods.</li>
