            <h2><span id="Most_Frequently_Asked_Interview_Questions">Most Frequently Asked Interview Questions</span></h2>
            <h3><span id="Q_1_Explain_Continuous_Integration_Continuous_Delivery_and_Continuous_Deployment">Q #1) Explain <a href="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/continuous-integration/">Continuous Integration</a>, <a href="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/what-is-continuous-delivery/">Continuous Delivery</a>, and <a href="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/continuous-deployment-tools/">Continuous Deployment</a>.</span></h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> In the current software industries, DevOps helps with Continuous integration, delivery, and deployment for agile environments all done using automated scripts.</p>
            <p><strong>Continuous Integration</strong></p>
            <p>In the agile development environment, developers integrate their changes to the central repository that contains builds multiple times in a day. These builds are stored based on their version in version control systems like Git, SVN, or CVS.</p>
            <p>The changed code files added are validated for syntax style, code quality, and compile-time error using automated tests before final integration with the build during release.</p>
            <p><strong>Continuous Delivery</strong></p>
            <p>It is an extension of continuous integration, where the changes to your codebase can be deployed to the testing or development environment on a successful build. With continuous delivery, there is an improvement in velocity, productivity, and sustainability. You can plan to release your codebase daily, weekly, or deploy production quickly with continuous delivery.</p>
            <p><strong>Continuous Deployment</strong></p>
            <p>Based on well-designed and reliable test automation, releasing developer changes to the codebase from the version control repository to production is defined as continuous deployment. Improved productivity, the real-time response of developers to market demands, and any defects and release of daily stress have become things of the past with continuous deployment.</p>
            <h3><span id="Q_2_Explain_Domain-driven_Design">Q #2) Explain Domain-driven Design.</span></h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Domain-driven Design focuses on core domain and business logic related to domain problems, with a complex design based on domain models and collaborations with domain and technical experts to resolve specific domain problems. The domain model consists of data, goals, metrics, ideas, and knowledge about the domain problem to be resolved.</p>
            <h3><span id="Q_3_Describe_the_Single_Responsibility_Principle">Q #3) Describe the Single Responsibility Principle.</span></h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Single Responsibility Principle in short can be described as each class should have a single purpose and responsibility, thereby making software implementation easy and preventing side-effects resulting from changes made in the future.</p>
            <p>With more often changes in class, dependencies of other classes also get affected, increasing complexity. With a single responsibility in class, the number of bugs reduces, and the speed of development increases.</p>
            <p>The real-time example of a single responsibility principle is Java Persistence API (JPA) with managing data persisting in a relational database in a standard way being the only responsibility.</p>
            <h3><span id="Q_4_Explain_SOLID_principles">Q #4) Explain SOLID principles.</span></h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> SOLID represents the initials of design principles popular in the development of object-oriented software, making it easy to remember them.</p>
            <p><strong>The list of these principles is listed below:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Single Responsibility Principle</li>
            <li>Open/Closed Principle</li>
            <li>Liskov Substitution Principle</li>
            <li>Interface Segregation Principle</li>
            <li>Dependency Inversion</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><span id="Q_5_How_would_you_deal_with_memory_leaks_in_Java_applications">Q #5) How would you deal with memory leaks in Java applications?</span></h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> When the garbage collector fails to identify unused objects, reduces the amount of memory allocated to the Java application. The unused object still referred to in the application results in OutOfMemoryError making the application less reliable. This results in a memory leak.</p>
            <p><strong>Memory leaks can be a result of the following:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Use of unused object reference.</li>
            <li>Using Static objects.</li>
            <li>Failing cleaning up of Native system resources.</li>
            <li>Defects in Third-party libraries.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>We can prevent a memory leak in the following ways:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>You should not create unnecessary objects.</li>
            <li>Minimize using String Concatenation</li>
            <li>Use String Builder to append, insert, replace and delete operations on String.</li>
            <li>Avoid storing excessive data in the session.</li>
            <li>Use time out for sessions no longer in use.</li>
            <li>Avoid the use of System.gc() method.</li>
            <li>Limit using static objects, if used explicitly refer them to null.</li>
            <li>Finally block close Connection, Statement, and ResultSet.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><span id="Q_6_What_are_the_twelve-factor_application_principles">Q #6) What are the twelve-factor application principles?</span></h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The twelve-factor app methodology is used in order to build software as a service. It is applied to all applications written in any programming language and uses a combination of cache, database, memory, and queue as backing services.</p>
            <p><strong>The twelve factors are as listed below:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Admin processes: </strong>Automated scripts for the admin task can be packaged along with the application or in source control to ensure they run in the same environment like that of an application.</li>
            <li><strong>Build, release, run: </strong>The delivery pipeline should have three separate stages—build, release and run.</li>
            <li><strong>Backing services: </strong>backing services like database, <a href="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/free-smtp-server/">SMTP</a>, or FTP server, web services should be treated as attached services and should be managed by the execution environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Codebase: </strong>Maintain the one-to-one association between versioned codebases. Use branches for different versions to avoid complexity with a repository.</li>
            <li><strong>Configuration: </strong>Environment-specific configuration should be stored in the environment and not in the application.</li>
            <li><strong>Concurrency: </strong>The application should handle load-balanced requests for multiple identical nodes running simultaneously and scale horizontally for the processes and threads in parallel execution using a feature of handling multithreading in a <a href="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/java/java-virtual-machine/">Java virtual machine</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Dependencies: </strong>The services running in the application should declare dependencies explicitly and should not rely on system-level libraries or tools. You can install apache maven to maintain application dependencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Disposability: </strong>Application processes should be disposable, and applications should have a quick start-up and graceful shutdown process. During the shutdown, it should not accept any new tasks but allow the existing tasks to complete.</li>
            <li><strong>Development/Production parity: </strong>The gap between application development, test environment, and production deployment should be minimal.</li>
            <li><strong>Logs: </strong>The application when executed, should have logged as a stream of events that should be integrated with ELK stack or Splunk as centralized logging.</li>
            <li><strong>Processes: </strong>Application transient processes should not share anything and are stateless in nature. The backing services should be present to store persistent data.</li>
            <li><strong>Port binding: </strong>Applications should be self-contained and accessible to HTTP ports.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><span id="Q_7_List_the_differences_between_monolithic_SOA_and_microservices_architecture">Q #7) List the differences between monolithic, SOA, and microservices architecture.</span></h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Application architecture is categorized into three major categories – monolithic, SOA, and microservices. The definition, and differences between them are explained below:</p>
            <p><strong>Monolithic</strong> applications are single tiered wherein data access and user interface code are combined in a single platform. Ecommerce software as a service (SaaS) is an example of a monolithic application.</p>
            <p><strong>Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) </strong>applications use network services such as the web, and mobile applications using the Global Positioning System (GPS) to send the current locations is an example of SOA architecture.</p>
            <p><strong>Microservices</strong> architecture is a collection of loosely-coupled services where services are fine-grained and protocols are lightweight. Amazon Web Services and Netflix are some examples of microservices applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> In Sharding single dataset is distributed across multiple databases and eventually stored on multiple machines.</p>
            <p><strong>Benefits database sharding offer is listed below:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Improved Read/Write Throughput: </strong>With reading and write operations assigned to a single shard, and dataset distributed across multiple shards. The capacity for reading and writing operations is enhanced.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Storage Capacity: </strong>Capacity to store increases with infinite scalability on increasing shards count.</li>
            <li><strong>High availability: </strong>Shard offers higher availability in two ways – First, with each shard a replica set, each data is replicated. Second, the entire shard becomes unavailable for distributed data, the database remaining partially functional, and part of the schema on different shards.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
            <li><strong>Class: </strong>Class area in JVM stores class, variable, method, and constructor code of Java program. It stores runtime constant pool, method, and field data – class-level data of every class and method code.</li>
            <li><strong>Heap: </strong>Objects are created and stored in the heap area. Heap memory is allocated for arrays, class interfaces, and objects at runtime.</li>
            <li><strong>Stack: </strong>There is a private JVM stack for each of the threads that stores partial results and data that is required while returning value for performing dynamic linking and method. Java stack stores frame created at every method invocation.</li>
            <li><strong>Program Counter Register: </strong>Special method carried out by the JVM thread has a program counter register associated with the thread. JVM instruction address is stored in the non-native method of a program counter, whereas the program counter value is undefined for the native method. The native pointer on the platform or return address can be stored on the program counter register.</li>

            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> In Java – The collection interface and Map interface are two root interfaces of Java collection classes. Prior to the Collection framework – Arrays Vectors or Hashtables were used to group Java objects.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Class</strong> is a prototype objects are created from these prototypes and represent a set of methods or properties common to one type of all the objects.</li>
            <li><strong>Interface</strong> like class, can have variables and methods, with methods declared as abstract having only a method signature but without a body. Interface – blueprints for class, instructs class what to do and what not to do.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> In modern web applications, the session tracking feature helps the server to remember clients and previous visitors with a session for each user. It helps in the personalization of profiles, safety, and security for eCommerce applications.</p>
            <p><strong>You can manage sessions for Java application build with JSP and Servlet in the following four ways:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Cookies</li>
            <li>HTTPS and SSL</li>
            <li>Hidden Form fields</li>
            <li>URL rewriting</li>

            <p><strong>Answer: The exception is handled in multiple ways in the Spring MVC framework in the following ways:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Controller-based classes: </strong>Using @ExceptionHandler annotation using exception class as an argument in exception handling methods in controller classes.</li>
            <li><strong>Global exception handler: </strong>Spring provides @ControllerAdvice annotation are used with any class for defining global exception handler. This exception is used when the controller class cannot handle exceptions.</li>
            <li><strong>HandleExceptionResolver: </strong>In order to create a global exception handler HandleExceptionResolver interface can be implemented. We can define default implementation classes in the Spring bean configuration file for spring framework exception handling benefits.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><span id="Q_17_What_are_ACID_properties">Q #17) What are ACID properties?</span></h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A single unit of work by accessing and updating the content in the database is described as a Transaction. Using Read and Write operations access to records (data) from the database is handled by the transaction. The consistency in the database, before and after the transaction, is maintained by ACID properties.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Atomicity:</strong> The transaction in the database takes place successfully or does not take place at all.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency: </strong>Before the transaction and after the transaction, the database remains consistent.</li>
            <li><strong>Isolation: </strong>There occur independent multiple transactions without any interference</li>
            <li><strong>Durability: </strong>The changes due to successful transactions are reflected even the system fails.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><span id="Q_18_List_the_beneficiaries_of_API_reusability">Q #18) List the beneficiaries of API reusability.</span></h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Using API functionality for multiple applications instead of creating new ones for each application is known as API reusability.</p>
            <p>There are two beneficiaries of API reusability:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Information is shared internally for multiple applications for utilization. <strong>For example,</strong> API designed to manage inventory can also be utilized for e-commerce order updates by the marketing team, resource management by the human resource team, as well as the ERP system.</li>
            <li>Third parties use the API for retrieving information,<strong> for example,</strong> the payment gateway API application is integrated with multiple payment options used by third parties. The customization, like payment using foreign currency, can be applied as a wrapper to this API.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><span id="Q_19_List_the_difference_between_SOAP_and_REST_services">Q #19) List the difference between SOAP and REST services.</span></h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The services that are built on standards such as TCP/IP, HTTP, XML, and Java can be invoked over the network to communicate between software using XML or JSON-based medium for data exchange. SOAP and REST are commonly used web services.</p>
            <p><strong>The difference between them is listed below:</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an application programming interface (API) for Java programming language that decides how the client interface connects with or accesses the database. A part of Java Standard Edition, JDBC API has classes and interfaces that help connect the backend database with the front-end client.</p>
            <p>Hibernate is an object-relational mapping (ORM) tool and Java persistent framework that helps to store and retrieve data from the database and maps this data with Java objects using XML.</p>
            <h3><span id="Q_22_How_would_you_resolve_database_deadlock">Q #22) How would you resolve database deadlock?</span></h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The database deadlock is a situation that occurs when two or more transactions are waiting for other transaction to get complete and give away the lock. The deadlock occurs when both processes are on hold for each other to finish. We can avoid this situation by allocating resources in such a way that deadlock never occurs.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>A queue can be designed that would verify each request before sending it to the database.</li>
            <li>Use very few cursors in our queries to prevent the locking of database tables.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Storing session info is a better option than using session info in a request, as the latter option is vulnerable and can be intercepted. The respective domain can only access session info stored in cookies in order to ensure the right session information is provided by the user.</p>
            <h3><span id="Q_24_What_are_the_main_differences_between_the_first-level_and_second-level_cache_in_Hibernate">Q #24) What are the main differences between the first-level and second-level cache in Hibernate?</span></h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The first-level cache in Hibernate is accessible to Sessions and maintained at the Session level whereas the second-level cache is available to all Sessions and maintained at the SessionFactory level.</p>
            <p>For the second-level cache–concurrency strategy to be decided, cache expiration and physical cache attributes need to be configured. The first-level cache does not need any additional configuration.</p>

            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> LazyInitializationException is thrown by the Hibernate framework while initializing a lazily fetched association to another entity without active session context.</p>
            <p><strong>You can avoid it using the following steps:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>By setting parameter value, lazy=false in hibernate config file.</li>
            <li>At mapping setting @Basic(fetch=FetchType.EAGER).</li>
            <li>By making sure the dependent objects are accessed before the closing of the session.</li>
            <li>Using Hibernate.initialize.</li>

            <ul>
            <li>Optimization of queries using rewriting queries and using Prepared Statements.</li>
            <li>Restructuring of Indexes.</li>

            <ul>
            <li>Insert record in a database table, if an exception occurs, update an existing record.</li>
            <li>Verify if the record exists and update if the record exists, or else insert a new record.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Decision on the selection of approach will depend on</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Are we using hibernate indices, and how costly is a call to the database Approach 1 should be selected if the DB call is costly.</li>
            <li>The advantage of using the 1st call to DB in the first approach should be bigger than Bookkeeping for exceptions.</li>
            <li>If the DB table is empty, using the 1st approach will make sense, as it will pass without any exception.</li>
